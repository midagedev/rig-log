# bloomery — 트리아지(열린 항목)

여기는 **아직 할 일만** 있다. 2026-09-25 새벽에 다시 썼다 — 그 전 판(라운드 보고 절 스무 개와 09-23 GPU 선 목록의 원문, 155 KB)은 [`plan-ledger.md`](plan-ledger.md) 「plan-triage.md 2026-09-25 이전 판」에 원문 그대로 있고, 항목의 근거·수치·기제가 필요하면 거기서 찾는다. 항목은 받을 라운드별로 한 줄씩이고 크기는 XS·S·M·L이다. 착륙한 줄은 지운다(원문은 장부, 결과는 커밋 메시지와 rig-log). 수치는 `[유도]`가 아니면 실측이다.

## Release 0.3.0 (or 0.2.10) — orchestration (the user, 2026-10-10 ~08:40: "worker들과 협력해서 릴리즈를 위한 오케스트레이션 가속")

**The version** (the user, ~09:20, "이게 다 되고 나면 0.3.0 갈만하지"): 0.3.0 if the cut carries all three pillars —
vision on the Qwen3-VL family's three seats, the unified tier with V4.1 and GLM attached, quantwide's Qwen3.6 and
Qwen3-30B ports — beside T1; if a pillar slips, 0.2.10. MiMo and Kolibri move to 0.3.x. The trains keep their names.

Scope (user, 10-10, memory release-0210-scope): T1 pulled in (the prompt headline), vision beyond V4.1, a stepwise promo
video from 0.2.6. Plus what is already queued: T3 (decode), r4glm + k1iq3s (GLM UD-IQ4_XS loads on big hosts),
effortlow (GLM `reasoning_effort: "none"` → low), the gate tools. Release-quality rules hold: same-lease A/B for every
speed piece, the user-facing pass, the dogfood pass, issue reporters thanked (@avlp12, #3).

### Tracks (one owner each; file boundaries decide who edits what)

| Track | Owner | Owner files | Pieces, in order |
|---|---|---|---|
| L — orchestration, T1, T3 R2, vision, release | leader (Sonnet rounds + opus reviews) | `crates/runtime/src/{sched,splitwalk}.rs`, `crates/gpu/src/host/{leg,xstream}.rs` and `host/mod.rs`'s pick entries (R1a); `crates/gpu/src/arch/qwen3moe/{wide38,body38}.rs`, `crates/gpu/src/host/{swap,batch}.rs`, `crates/runtime/src/xsplit.rs` (T1 R1b/R1c, until T1 lands); `crates/vision`, `crates/gpu-vision`, `serve_seats/decide.rs`, `crates/serve/src/{api,media}.rs`, README, release tools | T1 R1a + R1b (running) → opus review → R1c on their tips (the lead's rounds; T1 lands as one piece). **T3 R2** on t3r1's tip 2ca6c2f0 (the warm call; c_hot; HOST_LANES and warm on/off A/Bs), hunks in `moe.rs`/`step.rs` sequenced with W1's unitier. effortlow (running). Vision: design (running) → R0′ refs (mmproj F16 of all four fetched to `/models/mmproj/`) → R2 tower → R3 injection → R4 seats; Clef and Qwen3.6 first; Qwen3.8's injection after T1 R1c unless the design keeps it out of `wide38.rs`/`body38.rs`. GLM NVMe tier: a Mac design round only (0.2.11). Trains, landings, release pass, video sitting + opus video round |
| W1 — the unified tier (unitier), gate tools | worker1 | `tools/gpu-gate.sh`, `tools/gate-paths.tsv`, `tools/recipes.py`; unitier's: `crates/gpu/src/host/{swap_source,nvtier,swap,batch}.rs` (prompt union), `crates/levers/src/lib.rs` `room_for`, V4.1's `chain/ffn.rs` attach, `crates/gpu-glm5next`'s host tier, `crates/placement` (hunks told to W2 first) | gpuwall + gatepaths2 → C1 → steps-reference table (#4, the lead picks) → **unitier** (the user, 10-10: the unified residency controller ships in 0.2.10, V4.1 and GLM attached; design `specs/worker2/unitier/design.md` rev 2, W2 the design contact): R2 `excl` → R4 `arenaunion` (lifts the paged one-column and draft-off refusals) → R8a `offrule` owner lift → R7 V4.1 attach → GLM attach (an opus design addendum first: GLM UD-IQ4_XS on a 128 GB host) |
| W2 — quant (quantwide), fixture tier | worker2 | r4glm/k1iq3s files, `crates/gpu-gates` fixture-tier files, then quantwide's: `crates/placement/src/kernels.rs`, `crates/gpu/src/expert.rs`, `crates/model/src/arch/coverage.rs`, `qwen35moe/hparams.rs`, `body35.rs`, the qwen3moe family's type pins | fxr4 + fxr5 (box, after W1's phase 3) → r4glm + k1iq3s Mac-green on main (functional GLM UD-IQ4_XS load once the download ends, ~09:00) → **quantwide** (`specs/worker2/quantwide/design.md`; the user, 10-10: broad quant support ships in 0.2.10): R1 the common dispatch table → R2 qwen3moe port (+13.0 % of downloads, repo-weighted) → R3 qwen35 port + nextn read as `Unused` (+9.2 %) → K3 IQ4_XS/IQ4_NL card (+22.3 %) if time; each with a functional `-hf` default-file load. `body35.rs` and `coverage.rs` are W2's; vision's Body35 injection rebases on R3. Qwen3.8's Q8_0 PLE refusal (`body38.rs`) waits for T1 |
| W3 — MiMo-V2.6-Flash (then Kolibri-1) | worker3 (opened 10-10 ~09:30) | `crates/gpu-mimo2`, `crates/model/src/arch/mimo2`, `crates/refset/src/arch/mimo2`, a new `serve_seats/mimo2.rs`, `crates/gpu/src/mxfp4_sel.rs` (new) | the user, 10-10: more supported models. The serve seat (on GLM's seat pattern, common owners) → R5 card experts → R6 MTP → R7 through W1's unified tier. Kolibri-1 (design `specs/leader/kolibri1/report.md`; not in llama.cpp mainline) after, if time |

Shared files: `crates/levers/src/registry.rs` and `crates/gpu-gates/src/record.rs` take one owner per round; the
second editor re-reads fresh and edits last. **No round runs `just records-refresh` or commits regenerated
schema/plans**: the lead runs it once at each train cut, after applying the diffs in order. `docs/plan-triage.md` is
the lead's. T3 R2 (lead) and unitier (W1) share `moe.rs` and `host/step.rs`: hunks are named before either round starts.

### Trains
- **Tiers** (user-approved 10-09: a clean calibration moves trains to fixture A; releases keep the real tier). The
  train029a calibration found 0 items green in fixture and red in real. 0210a carries fxstack (the fixture oracle
  sets, item 9), so it runs **fixture + the deferred real-only list** (~61 min); 0210b runs **fixture A** (~27 min);
  the release batch runs the real tier.
- **0210a (cut time set from the workers' ETAs):** t3r1 2ca6c2f0, r4glm, k1iq3s, fxstack/fxr6, gatepaths2, gpuwall, C1, effortlow, T1 R1a + R1b.
  gpuwall moves every GPU key, so the union runs the full `just affected` list. A piece not Mac-green at the cut waits
  for 0210b. T1 and T3 R2 are not gated on 0210a: they land as whole pieces in whichever train they make. Express before it: anything whose gate set is small and disjoint
  (effortlow if serve-only).
- **0210b (cut when each speed piece has its A/B):** T1 (R1a–R1c, +R2/R3 if opened), T3 R2, vision R2–R4. Then the
  release. **Vision is a cut criterion:** by the time the vision design returns its round plan, the lead tells the user
  which family (Qwen3-VL: Clef, Qwen3.6, Qwen3.8; GLM-ViT) will not make 0.2.10, and why.

### Release cut
0210b green → `just release-build 0.2.10` → user-facing pass (candidate tarball's `bloomery-serve`, both cards, `a` and
`bp`, a short and a ≥ 4K prompt, levers unset) → dogfood pass (candidate serve + one outsource round) → notes (thank
@avlp12) → tag with the user's OK → opus release-clip round. The clip measures only 0.2.10; its "since 0.2.6" climb is
one part of the clip, drawn from derived values for the older releases (labelled derived), with no old-tarball sitting
and no digging through old records (the user, 10-10).

### Box queue (the lead orders it; a sitting holds `/root/bloomery-<owner>-hold`)
1. W1 gp2box phase 3 (12–20 min) — now.
2. W2 fxr4 (~10) + fxr5 (~8).
3. Rounds' `--round-ledger` batches (yield to a hold).
4. 0210a fixture + real tier (lead).
5. W1 T3 c_hot + A/Bs; W2 T1 R1c A/B (A6000, card `t1-split-pp`).
6. Vision gates; release pass.
The GLM download (idle IO priority) ends ~09:00; a lease sitting waits on its IO pressure until then.

## Release 0.2.7 — orchestration (the user, 2026-10-07 evening)

Scope, from the user: vision input, the prefill levers, a second decision model, Xiaomi MiMo-V2.6-Flash. Models are
added now **to improve the code**: each attachment lifts the logic it shares into common owners before the model's
own code, and every landing reports the files and lines it touched outside the model's own crate. The baselines are
Qwen3.8 core at 32 files and GLM-5.3 core at 28. The user rule for releases now holds: the user-facing pass runs
before the tag (AGENTS.md 「Commands」, Releases).

### Tracks (one owner each; file boundaries decide who may edit what)

| Track | Owner | Files it owns | Items, in order |
|---|---|---|---|
| L: decision models, vision, release | leader | `crates/decision`, `serve_seats/{decide,ds41}.rs`, `bind.rs`, `ds41_media.rs`, `crates/serve`, `crates/hf`, README, release tools | ① `cleflayout` (GLM, running): the decide seat reads llama.cpp's clef layout, which fixes 0.2.6's looping `--hf bartowski/…` line ② `decide2` (GLM design, running) → its implementation round: the second decision model, `crates/decision` made generic (lev/Kev family first) ③ `visseat2` (GLM, running): V4.1 `--mmproj` in the server, 10-06 work rebased ④ Clef vision (`clefvis` design) after ② and ③ share their owners ⑤ timed sittings and the release train |
| W1: MiMo, placement | worker1 | `crates/model/src/arch/mimo2`, `crates/models`, `crates/placement`, `crates/refset/src/arch/mimo2`, `crates/gpu/src/flash_gqa.rs`, `rope_neox.rs`, `mxfp4_sel.rs` (new) | ① `mimo1` (GLM, running): R1 the reader + lifts (router row, AttnShape V width, per-layer arrays) ② R2 refset (box, ik dump of the RL/MOPD file) ③ R3a/R3b flash K≠V, window, sinks ④ R4 first e2e, all experts on the host ⑤ R5 card experts (MXFP4 `_sel`, `CardFormat` row) ⑥ R6 MTP ⑦ R7 residency ⑧ R8 prompt path. Design: the lead's specs `mimo26/report.md` §4–§6. Then the open placement items below (q38big q3/q7/q8, Qwen3.x unset load on device 0, the never-run `sampled_served` arm) |
| W2: prefill, kernels, IQ | worker2 | `crates/gpu/src/host/*`, `crates/gpu/src/arch/qwen3moe/*`, `crates/gpu/src/{iq,iq_sel}.rs`, `crates/qdot`, `crates/runtime/src/xsplit*` | ① `pfcopy` (GLM, running): ppgap lever 2 (per-batch landed events), then lever 1 (run-ahead admits) ② ppgap lever 3 (selected flash: one block per (row, kv head), no 3× re-staging) and lever 4 (delta scan pipeline); lever 3 edits `flash_gqa.rs`, so it runs after W1's R3 lands or as W1's file with W2's spec ③ `capsync` (branch, box proof `specs/iq/capsync/box-proof.sh`) ④ the IQ file slower than Q4 at P = 512 (775 vs 943 tok/s, cause unread) ⑤ IQ host-leg gate (the Q3 file's e2e arm, run twice bit-equal) ⑥ `resprofile` (branch; `host/swap.rs`, after pfcopy) ⑦ more IQ types (IQ3_S, IQ2_*, IQ1_M, BF16): Strata-style files and the V4-Flash port |
| T: gate and tool speed | leader, as GLM rounds | `tools/gate-batch.sh`, `tools/gpu-gate.sh`, `tools/box*.sh`, `tools/gate-paths.tsv`, `crates/model/src/fixture` | the fixture tier (`fxcommon` branch → R1 `fxq38gen` → R2/R8 → R3…), gate-batch clean stop, gpu-gate.sh lock order, `gate-paths.tsv` rows (coverage.rs, mtp.rs, weights.rs), `check-loads` split (mac-static 59 → ~30 s), levers XSTREAM unset text |

The ppgap levers 1–4 together predict 1,258 → 2,000–2,700 tok/s at P = 4096 on the A6000 [derived, the lead's specs
`ppgap/report.md` §⑤]. Decode needs no round: the 4090 gap sits inside its hardware and file envelope.

### How the tracks run

- A track owner is a session (worker1, worker2) or the leader. It launches its own GLM rounds (`--effort max`, one
  worktree each, `--label` named by purpose), reviews their diffs, runs their owning gates with
  `tools/gate-batch.sh --round-ledger`, and commits to its own branch. **main moves only by the leader**, which
  re-runs the landing gates under its ledger.
- Round loop: `just mac-static main` (≤ 1 min) before a round reports.
- **Express vs train.** A branch whose `just affected --narrow` set is small or disjoint lands alone when green:
  decision, serve, hf, vision seat, tools. Branches touching `crates/gpu`, `crates/models` or `crates/placement` (77–120
  gates) ride **one train** (branches W1-R1/R3, W2-pfcopy/lever 3/capsync) when two or more are green. The train cuts
  at a time the leader announces to both workers a session ahead.
- **Box.** Functional gates take any idle card. Timed numbers are the leader's, in sittings under a hold
  (`/root/bloomery-<owner>-hold`), each ≤ 30 min with its card. A worker asks the leader for a sitting. Box jobs over
  30 minutes (downloads, R-b batches) need the user's approval.
  - The MiMo MOPD download (170 GB) is running under the user's go (2026-10-07).
  - The RL file is on the box already.
- **Coverage table up front.** Every feature round reports placement × model × binary on/off. The leader tells the
  user every off cell in the landing message.
- Each landing message also states the files touched outside the model's crate (model rounds) and the gate wall.

### 0.2.7 cut criteria

- the cleflayout fix;
- V4.1 vision in the server;
- the second decision model;
- pfcopy levers 1–2 with a timed A/B;
- MiMo through R4 (first e2e, all host experts) at least;
- then the user-facing pass and the tag.

MiMo R5–R8, the levers 3–4 and the fixture tier may land later in the line.

State on 2026-10-08 07:00 (main `d78c38d6`): the cleflayout fix, V4.1 vision in the server (`--mmproj`), the second
decision model (lev) and pfcopy lever 2 (timed: pp4096 +3.2 %, under its band; cause below) are on main. Open: MiMo
through R4 (worker1's train 2 carries R3a and the lifts), then the user-facing pass and the tag.

### What the 10-07/08 night left (leader — train 1 `68c0c067`, 143/143 green; train 2 running)

**leader**
- visseat2: the FAIL-first of `mmproj_the_placeholder_expands_to_the_span` was not run (rc 75, both cards held by
  train 2); rerun on the mutant tree after train 2. XS.
- visseat2: cuda-core 0.3.1 `DeviceBuffer::zeroed`/`from_host` allocate on the thread's current context but record
  `stream.context()` → nvlabs-ledger row 41; `serve_seats/ds41.rs` `on_encoder_card` is the workaround, removed when
  capsync binds at allocation. S.
- visseat2: `encoder_seat` (`serve_seats/ds41.rs`) and `seat_of` (`gate_ds41_serve.rs`) are two copies of one rule →
  one owner in the lib. S. The card-name token `.replace(' ', "_")` in five places → one helper. XS.
- visseat2: `--place a` with the DSpark draft on the 3090 puts the encoder beside the draft with no fit check. S.
  Loading the encoder after the model costs ≤ 1.1 s a start [derived] that overlap would save. S.
- No gate builds the release feature set (`glm5next,clef,vision`); a weekly item would close the binary cell. S.
  README.ko.md vision and lev rows (the leader writes Korean). XS.
- decidelat (design, 2026-10-08): R0 decidemeasure → R1 resetzero (−3.3..−3.8 ms) → R2 hosthead2 (head 22–28 → 5–8
  ms) ∥ R3 decideprefix (36-id prefix, −8.7/−22 ms) → R4 card head only on R2's residual → R5 schema-first opt-in.
  A6000 103 → ~69 ms, 3060 225 → ~165 ms [derived]. After train 2. M.
- T: `tools/gpu-gate.sh --cmd` (lev-dump.sh symlinks itself into `target/release` to take the card lock). S.
- T: `just records-refresh` plans `tools/flow/plans/ds41-p*.rec` from live MemAvailable (the same code gave three
  different plans); pin the planning machine's memory figure. S.
- T: gate-paths rows for `gpu-mimo2/**`, `app/arch/mimo2/**`, `models/**`, `model/lib.rs`, `gpu/fault.rs`,
  `flash_gqa`/rope, `host/swap_source.rs`, and worker2's nvtier patch. S.
- e2eharness: the named-tie path (second → tie_numbers → tie_allowed) never fires on any recipe set (0 ties
  measured), so its mutant stays green; needs a forced-tie arm or a tie set. S.

**worker1**
- `BreakEven` lib test repeats the qwen38 seat's rate literals. S.
- Stem/req/opt/required tables duplicated between `glm5next` and `mimo2` `roles.rs` → one lift. S.
- e2e harness conversions next: qwen4exp (−205 lines; a short tap becomes a named panic), qwen3moe/qwen35moe (their
  rel/quant_gap differ in algorithm: rename, not merge). S–M.

**worker2**
- A contended load picks a lighter Qwen3.8 prompt plan for the whole process: the lane probe at load sets m*, a probe
  beside another load reads low (7.4 vs 20.6 GB/s), and the process then admits ~30 % fewer experts (4,095 vs 5,805
  at 4096) for its life. The sitting runner tags it [probe-off]; the engine does not correct it. Derive among:
  re-probe at the first prompt call, max of N probes, a quiet probe point the engine controls, or the call's own
  measured copy rate updating m*. S–M.
- `pickrate` (next pfcopy lever): pfcopy lever 2 gave +3.2 % because the pick's copies run at ~15 GB/s through one
  staging thread (~24 ms a layer); N copy threads at the lane's 20 GB/s ≈ −0.29 s at pp4096 (+9..+10 %), −51..−57 ms
  at Q4 512 [derived]. M.
- iqtile follow-up: `tile_units` IQ rows in `crates/model/src/ops.rs`. S.
- pickrule: the triple measured pp4096 −399 ms (−12.8 %) but pp512 +57 ms slower; redesigned (τ a per-width level,
  0.125 µs × card picks); implementation running. M.
- nvtier: R2a held until R2b (the paged plan's union reads twice until the host-leg wiring). R3 sitting approved by
  the user (2026-10-08, ~25–30 min, R0's 20 s re-measure inside). The default at small RAM (max arena when room < ½
  host-leg bytes) trades pp4096 610–700 → 390–430 for decode 13–19 → 26–29 [derived]: the landing states that cost in
  the coverage table and the README limits.

## After 0.2.9 (10-10, leader — train029a: worker2's binslots chain, w1train, hostfloor, poolret, packsched2, prefill1, stepsim, sit3090, hfarch, nofixture, mixfix)

### What servestop left (worker1)
- servestop F4 design (a′): each seat names q = its checkpoint spacing (4096 on Qwen3.8/GLM), a quantum grid at
  absolute multiples, a cut-vs-whole gate per seat; GLM first, Qwen3.8 second, V4.1 excluded (CED holes). A decision for
  later.
- `keep_alive`'s own 400 for an unreadable request is outside `api::Answers` (~3 lines).
- `tools/spawn-allow.txt:12`'s reason for `decide.rs` is stale (1 line).

### The unitier R1 probe (worker2)
- Unified tier (0.2.9), worker2's R1 probe (10-09, functional, A6000 plan a 27G, arena 23.5e9): the paged plan's 72–74
  ms pass against 31.7 ms arena-0 is first-touch NVMe fills (5,194 fills, 16.3 GB, 1.0–1.1 ms each, O_DIRECT, ≈ 55
  ms a pass), not the drops (drop-off −3..−4 % p50, ≈ 0 mean). On a host with RAM to spare an arena fill could
  come from the page cache (`BLOOMERY_NVTIER_READ=buffered` exists; `buffered_reads=0` there). Price it on the depth
  runner's fresh-process window. S–M.

### What loadonce2 left (worker1)
- `check-recipes` rule: a recipe that redirects `gpu-gate.sh`'s stderr copies its `waited N s` line (loadonce2 found
  `gate-gpu-ds41-chat`'s 418 s row held 329 s of hidden V4.1 load-lock wait; that row dropped from `gate-times.tsv`
  10-09, backup `gate-times.tsv.bak-20261009-chatwait`).
- Load-once follow-ups: V4.1 `PREFILL_GROUP` has no runtime setter (`body.rs:275`), the lookup draft has no detach
  (`drop_captures` `pub(crate)`); each ~15 s a load.
- `state_back.rs:94` compares card counts, not names (a swapped card at the same index passes); `:79` the
  poisoned-mismatch text names one direction. XS each.

### What q38rtrace left (worker1)
- `route-trace-chat` / `route-trace-chat-q38` take no card gate lock (the driver is not `gpu-gate.sh`); worker1 held the
  A6000 lock by hand for the 10-09 recordings. Route them through `gpu-gate.sh`'s lock. XS–S.
- The `route-trace-chat` driver, a witness: at place a the host set is unpinned, and a concurrent big load evicts it
  silently (10-09 q38-stream3-4k: RSS 64 → 20 GB, majflt 590K → 953K, shard residency 53 % → 6.8 %, req
  ms/position 62.2/28.0/56.0 against d2's flat 18.7). Print shard residency and majflt at start and end of each request
  in the driver; its routes stay valid (greedy), its walls do not.
- `route-trace-chat`'s driver applies the template without `chat_template_kwargs` (thinking stays the template default)
  and a prompt row is one TSV line ("\n\n" becomes one space): a recorded trace of a thinking-off stream is not that
  stream. S.

### The stepsim evaluator (lead)
- stepsim evaluator: the `readme` preset's default hit 0.645 contradicts the README row (86.3 predicted vs 60.71); hit
  0.20–0.25 matches (synth-inversion Phase B). Fix the preset after Phase B; `server` 0.655 is a prose replay,
  unmeasured.
- stepsim evaluator, found by three Phase B synths (bytes, overlap F3, residency): `calibrate()` (`q38_step.py:812-834`)
  re-solves anchors (verify_row_frac on every machine; layer_extra_us, union_c_us on common-5090) under a scenario's
  `--set` unless the anchor itself is set, so byte/union/draft overrides get absorbed (5090 b1/L1 read −0.5/−2.6 %
  instead of +0.7/+4.2 %); and lat = anchor − bytes/bw_a6000 makes a byte cut alone read as a slowdown. Fix: a
  scenario-vs-correction flag (anchors solved once at today's constants). S.
- stepsim evaluator: the `readme` preset is a one-request model of a two-request row (README decode 60.71 = 2 requests
  summed; reproduced only at hit ≈ 0.24). S.
- stepsim evaluator: measured A6000 verify cost(k) 16.8/25.5/29.8/33.7 ms (`tape028/stream-a.log:57-59`) is
  front-loaded, the model is 2.7 ms short at w2; one hit for all depths; no fresh/chain per-request rows. S.
- stepsim evaluator: the lowhost preset (core_dram_gbs 12 assumed) is not a weak host. S.

### The expfast probe program (shelved)
- `discover/expfast-report.md` §7, the expfast probe program (shelved, open after the cut): R1 probe lever rows
  (`Class::X`, `at_main_probing`; only with R4), R2 `STEP_TRACE` (M, after q38rtrace), R3 runtime arms + `Body38`
  `StateBack` (M, after loadonce2/levphase2), R4 `probe.rs` injectors/idealizers (M–L, `crates/gpu` → its own
  train), R5 `card.py` probe/batch/look (S–M, Mac, no collision), R6 `exp-batch.sh` v1 (M, after packsched2), R7 pool
  honours affinity (S), R8 ROUTE+PRETOUCH (M+M), R9 remote fixture runner (S; fixture routers are random, so E3 decides
  no routing term), R10 scoped leases + A/A (M; the user's decision, after R4).

### What serveapi left (worker1)
- serveapi tracker rows (worker1 10-09): llama-server sampling fields we cannot honour (samplers, `typical_p`,
  `mirostat`, `dry_*`, `xtc_*`, `top_n_sigma`, `dynatemp_*`) are still silently ignored — a refusal-rule violation. M.
- `n_predict` < -1 silently → -1 where llama-server 400s. XS.
- tokenize's `content` of another type read as "" (1 line).
- `anthropic.rs:163-170` dead arm (3 lines).
- `tests/sampdraft.rs` Hold/Held duplicates `mock::Hold` (~60 lines).
- `anthropic.rs/responses.rs` native fields not swept by the typed reads. S.

### What quantwide, r4glm and k1iq3s left (worker2)
- GLM-5.3-Flash `UD-IQ4_XS` (157 GB, the file of a 10-09 X post: 5090 + 128 GB) does not load: routed gate/up are IQ3_S
  in 41 of 43 layers (IQ4_XS 1, Q3_K 1), down IQ4_XS 39 / Q6_K 3 / Q4_K 1, output Q6_K; every other tensor equals
  UD-Q4_K_XL (headers read 10-09 from the HF shards). IQ3_S has no activation format (`crates/gguf/src/quant.rs:1162`
  → NoActivationFormat), and GLM's card expert dispatch takes only Q4_K/Q5_K
  (`crates/gpu-glm5next/src/ffn.rs:536-570`). Needs: an IQ3_S host qdot kernel + activation format (S–M), card sel
  kernels behind one common iq dispatch (lift Qwen3.8's, M), and the prompt GEMM rows; on a 128 GB host also a GLM NVMe
  tier (unified tier, L). Expert bytes a token 0.77× UD-Q4_K_XL [derived: (2·3.44+4.25)/(2·4.5+5.5) bpw].
- `docs/models.md:40` says `UD-Q3_K_XL` does not run yet; README:45 and the 0.2.8 A6000 table run it. Stale line. XS.
- quantwide1 (worker2, opus, `specs/worker2/quantwide/report.md`): 35 of 489 serving files load (repo-weighted 17.0 %).
  Family ports alone → 42.7 %. Order R0 (hotfix) → R2 qwen3moe port → R3 qwen35 port + nextn Unused + shexp join
  → R4 GLM card-or-host rule → K1 IQ3_S host (with R4 loads GLM UD-IQ4_XS = the X post's file) → K2..K10. Next
  round after tag: R4+K1 first, R3 parallel.
- `README.md:45` "BF16 tensors are not loaded" is stale.
- gguf `lib.rs:781` q8_K 296 B (ik) vs mainline 292.
- gguf `lib.rs:898-910` `strict_tensors` ignores type sizing for Q4_0/Q4_1 (opens 24 bartowski GLM files, draft off).
- qdot `lib.rs:2126-3180` ~1,050 lines of V4.1 card-rule twins only gates call (wire or delete).
- Four duplicate type lists (`swap38.rs:32-38`, `qwen35moe/place.rs:114-125`, `card38.rs:301-380`, `TYPE_PINS`).
- Type id 41 clash: ik Q1_0_G128 vs mainline Q1_0.
- quantwide next (worker2, Sonnet, base main `eb41626d`): r4glm (`coverage.rs` GLM routed arm →
  `routed_unrun(card_routed)`) express first; k1iq3s (IQ3_S host: gguf grid + dequant, qdot AVX2 + mirror, ik refs,
  `iq3s-rate.card`) in parallel; R3 after r4glm. X-post file (GLM UD-IQ4_XS 156.8 GB, 50–65 min download) needs the
  user's OK (box job > 30 min) — ask in the morning; cheap shard-head --plan first.
- r4glm: GLM `UD-IQ4_XS` is host-only in every trunk MoE layer and GLM has no NVMe tier (`expert_nvme_tier` only in
  qwen35moe/qwen38 seats) → 156.8 GB must sit in host RAM: loads on the box (263 GB avail), refused by name on the
  X-post 128 GB machine → the X reply also needs the GLM NVMe tier (placement, roomone's area; unified tier goal).
- r4glm docs drift: `gpu-glm5next/src/swap.rs:16-19,38-43` (no Q3_K stack — false), `models/src/need.rs:298`
  `RoutedFormat` wording, `coverage.rs:39-40` `Glm5nextBody` doc, `shared/glm5next_tier.rs:106` `Shape::read` Q6_K-only
  host downs.
- r4glm next blockers: BoldingBuilds IQ3_XXS and ggml-org Q4_K on BF16 attention/hc pins.
- k1iq3s (worker2, done 00:1x): `29e05499` on `eb41626d` — gguf `IQ3S_GRID` + `dequant_iq3_s` + activation
  IQ3_S→Q8_K; qdot AVX2 dot + mirror + tiles + dispatch; `tools/ref` `iq3s_ref`/`iq3s_rate` + `dequant_ref` `types[]`;
  unsafe-ratchet qdot 102/56→109/60 PIN; Gate A = mirror (m1 red), Gate B = ik `DequantizerIQ3S` 0 ULP 64/64 (m2 red,
  A green), tile m3 red; ptx-scan `gate_e2e` identical. Landing step (worker2): refset `arch/dequant.rs` BUILD pin
  move + `just dump-ref-dequant` + `gate-1-1` + m4, together (`gate-1-1`/`gpu-gemm`/`gpu-iq`/`gpu-iq-sel` refuse
  between). Engine reach: IQ3_S routed stacks pass Qwen3.8/MiMo coverage (AtomicChat, mradermacher i1-IQ3_M) → host
  union; card `CardFormat::of(IQ3_S)=None`. Next train.
- k1iq3s measurement 1 (`iq3s-rate` + `iqhost-rate` rows, ~10–12 min lease) after the binary is on the box: card
  `iq3s-rate.card` predicts 4.6–6.2 GB/s/core at k=4096 (moved down from 5.6–7.6 before any timed run: 48 vpextrd +
  8 vextracti128, 333 instr/block) — under the union break-even 6.2–8.6 → read the fixed term first.

### What packsched2 left (worker2)
- `switch_candidate` rewrites `P_ENV` before its pos check (root of blocker 3, ~3 lines). S.
- `PYBAL` reads `f[8]`/`f[11]`/`f[12]`/`f[16]` positionally (pass `REC_FIELDS`, ~10). S.
- `rec_get` inside `$(…)` dies only its subshell (static name check, ~10). S.
- `mutant_of` does not syntax-check mutants (`bash -n` + py compile, ~15). S.
- ~25 `steal_case` times rows use bare keys. S.
- `fail()` dumps a stale `$out`. S.
- `/tmp/stkeep` + ~60 stray `gate-batch-*` dirs in the real `TMPDIR`. S.

### What hostfloor's window A left (worker2)
- `gate-gpu-nvtier`'s stepunion page-footprint clause counts any mapper's pages: worker2's hostfloor window A (10-09
  20:57–21:04) went red (+8,303 interior pages, at most 0 allowed) while worker1's q38rtrace serve (`--place a
  --cache-ram 0`) mapped the same Qwen3.8 file. Solo (X) in a landing batch, so trains do not see it; a round-ledger run
  beside another Qwen3.8 track goes red. Count only the gate's own mapping (mincore over its own VMAs) or refuse to
  start beside a mapper by name. S.

### The Mac (lead, 10-09)
- `tools/ref/lcpp-warm.sh`'s self-test leaks its Python llama-server stub: 21 alive on the Mac on 10-09
  (`/var/folders/…/lcpp-warm-self-test.*/llama-server -m /m.gguf …`, oldest 1 d 13 h). Kill the stub on exit (trap
  on the captured pid) and add a no-leftover check to the self-test. S. The lead does not kill the 21 by pattern; their
  pids go to a file first.
- Worktree cleanup after the cut: 147 worktrees remain. The Mac disk was 98 % (19 GiB free) on 10-09 ~21:20; the lead
  removed `target/` of 20 finished worktrees (clefvis*, defgaps, fxgen2, gatefix, levphase, loadonce1, nvbase, nvplan,
  paged2r, pagedoff, paghead*, roomneed, serve029*, stepunion, stepunion2, visseat, xdeinit) → 108 GiB free.

### What loadlock left (worker1)
- `visref.sh:56` / `justfile:1896-1897` `dump-ref-visref` takes the lock without `[group('v41-load')]`. XS–S.
- The 16 non-V4.1 `v41-load` recipes carry no reason comment (only `gate_nvtier.rs:54-56` states one). XS–S.
- `gpu-gate.sh:649-650/912-913` comments read V4.1-only. XS–S.
- `gate-batch.sh:1763-1776` checks group↔export but not model↔group. XS–S.
- packsched2's `CHAIN_SOLO_REAL` (`gate-batch.sh:362`) omits the two Qwen3.8 solo-real items with no reason. XS–S.

### What fxoracle left (worker2)
- `flip.rs:139` `tie_allowed` margin ≤ 2·dist always true at top == runner-up; `flip.rs:78-84` gap ≤ err always
  true on a top-k swap (only the cap decides; doc fix).
- `gate_qwen38_serve.rs:3364-3369` FileBound reason contradicts `qwen35moe/fixture.rs:84-89`; `ds41_skew.rs:143-146`
  mistagged FileBound.
- `margin_cap`/`flip_cap` copied (`gate_glm5next_mtp.rs:194`, `gate_qwen4exp_e2e.rs:2405/2432`); tally format copied in
  three gates.
- Refset `family.rs` `runs: Option<fn() -> String>` cannot fail. S–M.
- `dump-mtp.sh:47` hardcodes the real Qwen draft; `gguf-ranges.py` skips array keys.
- `gate_qwen4exp_e2e.rs:606-609` borrows `FREE_BAND` 0.10 underived.
- Refset real-file families identify by path only. M.
- fxr1 (worker2, Sonnet, base `fd8e0bff`, uncommitted): Mac-green; one CPU box job (~5 min) for the fill-digest `PINS`
  row approved 23:0x; then commit on `fxr1`. Lands red on `gate-refset`'s in-place test and `refset-check` until R2's
  dump sitting, as designed (not masked).
- Box handed to mixfix (worker1) first, then worker2's `fxtally` lib gate and fxr4/5/6 phase B.

### What lanex left (worker1; the tracker rows go to the packsched2 owner)
- RT rows wrong — nvtier 92 GB vs measured arena 23.49 GB, `qwen4exp-e2e` ~11 GB low, `iqleg` "both resident" but
  children sequential.
- `PACK_BUDGET` 299,000 B under its stated formula.
- Lane B idles 815 s in phase A (real-tier v41-load fixed to lane A, `gate-batch.sh:2103-2106`).
- The glm serve recipe comment self-contradicts.
- `qwen38-residency`'s `BLOOMERY_CARD=a6000` pin has no recorded fact.
- `gate-batch.sh:357-358` comment names a non-existent `PlanInputs::of` (it is `describe()`).
- lanex dropped (worker1 re-derivation 04:4x): packsched2 already took it; wall = chain 2,348 + X 2,056; the host-byte
  guard closes almost every pair. Wall levers in order: (a) shorten chain items, `glm5next-e2e` (773 s) first; (b)
  fixture tier; (c) X both-card + m items. worker1 next: (a) paper decomposition, then the room round.

### The 3090 sittings (sit3090, nsysgap)
- 3090 M1 (10-09 21:41): K1' 10.59 ms (in band) → slot-lanes design round opens; `leg_us` 10.40 ms above its 8.4..9.9
  band (391 slots) — host leg 5–12 % heavier than modelled; 47.6 tok/s one request at gate
  (`discover/m1-result.md`). rig-log cell to write.
- nsysgap (10-09 22:18, Sonnet, `discover/nsysgap-report.md`): `nsys-bridge.py` gains --post a,b / busy (union) / gaps /
  --joins N / --kernel / summary line / --self-test (22 assertions; 3 mutants each red on exactly its check), registered
  in check-recipes; `q38-3090-nsys.card` reader block rewritten (verify handoff is `ds41_ffn_handoff_10_cols`, router
  `qwen35moe_router_fused_512`; gap term = gaps_ms×1000/48). M2 sitting is now runnable.

### What the 0.2.9 hotfix left (glmarch, clefq3, hfarch)
- glmarch out-of-scope (worker2 10-09): `fetch_to` (`fetch.rs:386-431`) resumes a shorter cached file as a partial
  download instead of checking the `.verified` digest. S.
- glmarch out-of-scope: gate-side `expect_arch` (`lib.rs:196`) needs an Arch-level alias predicate so glm5-next passes
  without letting deepseek4 into ds41 gates. S.
- glmarch out-of-scope: the HF arch check of README `--hf` files. S, after the hotfix.
- glmarch out-of-scope: ik's arch table lacks "glm5-next" (`src/llama-arch.cpp:89`) — keep the old shard 1 for ik
  paths.
- Prevention (hotfix layer ②): a weekly/release check that each README `--hf` file's live listing (size+digest) equals
  the box's /models copy — the stale box copy hid both re-uploads. worker1's hfarch tool is the start; widen it from
  arch to size+digest.
- clefq3 out-of-scope: no test holds body35 `EMBED` = coverage pin (`coverage.rs:1058`, ~15 lines).
- clefq3 out-of-scope: odd-`n_sb` Q3_K/Q6_K embedding passes load, fails at first step (`body35.rs:870`).
- clefq3 out-of-scope: `ubatch.rs:341` calls `enqueue_embed_rows_q4k` directly for qwen3.
- clefq3 out-of-scope: `agreement.md` measured on the old Clef files.
- clefq3 out-of-scope: `elem.rs` and `crates/model/src/arch/mod.rs` have no gate-paths narrowing rows (raw affected
  125–127, S).
- clefq3 out-of-scope, box leftovers after release: `~/repo/bloomery-{glmarch,clefq3,clefq3-base,hotfix,fetchstale?}`,
  `/models/clef-flash-1005`, `/root/glmarch-ff`, `/root/clefq3-out`.
- `gate_clef_serve` loads the 10-02 qwen35-layout Q5_K_M + safetensors `--head`; move it to `/models/clef-flash-1005/`
  Q5_K_M (clef layout, no `--head`), pins re-derived (worker2, after the train). Keep `/models/clef-flash-1005`.

### What nsysgap left
- Mac self-test flakes under load avg 40–84 (nsysgap saw 3 of 5 `check-recipes` runs red on unrelated blocks):
  `q38-3090-server.sh` `B2: prompt_tokens=`, `lcpp-warm` `port0`, `gpu-gate.sh:235` `grep -q` early-exit Broken pipe,
  `stack-watch`/`lease-hold` "is gone". Stub-server waits need a condition, not a sleep; the grep -q pipe needs
  `grep >/dev/null`. S each. Logs: `scratchpad/nsysgap/check-recipes.run{2..5}-flake.out` (copy before the scratchpad
  goes). t3r1fix saw it too: `gpu-gate.sh` self-test flaked 3 of 6 under Mac load (`printf` Broken pipe at `:235`).

### What design-t3 and t3r1 left
- design-t3 (opus, 10-09 22:48, `discover/design-t3-report.md`): L3 warm of the next layer's predicted host experts in
  `wait_go`, CCD-major lanes (`threads::Pool::ccd_map`, `ops::Lanes{Flat,Ccd}`, both `run_group` and `UnionCall`),
  predictor pure in `crates/runtime/src/warm.rs` (reset per request; engine-shaped recall +9–11 pt over the finals').
  Predict 3090 server decode +8.5 % [+5.6, +14.0], --place gate one request +15.7 % [+11.6, +26.5] [derived from Mac
  replays]. Band set by c_hot. Rounds: R1 CCD map + warm routine (M, on fd8e0bff; A/B none, predicted 0) → S-T3a probe
  c_hot (6–8 box min, card `cards/t3-warm-probe.card`; 5–12 µs → R2) → R2 step-port warm + predictor (M–L;
  S-T3b gate predict 10..22 %, S-T3c server 5..12 %) → R3 table in host ledger (S, after roomone/hostfloor). R2 lands
  after levphase2. = the 0.2.10 decode candidate.
- t3r1 committed `959bced6` on branch `t3r1` (base `fd8e0bff`; rebase onto main after this train). 10 files
  +2352/−119; owning 5 gates green (round ledger), 3 ptx-scan pairs identical, 8 mutants red; mac-static/mac-test ok;
  unsafe-ratchet model 117→119/30→31 PIN(2026-10-09); gate-threads gains `--lib`. Report
  `specs/leader/t3r1/report.md`. Then S-T3a probe (6–8 min lease, card `specs/leader/t3r1/cards/t3-warm-probe.card`
  → copy into `docs/cards`) on the R1 bench binary.
- t3r1fix committed `642790eb` on `t3r1` (over `959bced6`): S1–S5 + N1–N11 closed (report
  `specs/leader/t3r1/fix-report.md`); 14 mutants killed; ptx-scan ×3 identical; mac-static ok, mac-test 716/0; round
  batch red=0. New lever `BLOOMERY_HOST_LANES` flat|ccd (default ccd) → R1 can be judged by a same-binary A/B (ccd vs
  flat arms) — required by AGENTS (dispatch path touched; S3/N5 move the split).
- Tracker (R27): the lever reaches `host_tier` through a process-global `AtomicBool` set at main (`set_host_lanes`)
  instead of the `HostRun`/pool constructor — thread it through when R2 touches the step port.

### What roomone left (worker1)
- roomone tip `863614cc` (worker1, branch `roomone` on `ee53e7c6` + rrroom `e772219e`/`84d59d2d`): affected 125/141 + 2
  weekly; needs records-refresh. FAIL-first done (bind glm reserve, declaration, hw hold_card A6000). Pending after
  rebase: anchor-only mutant, `gate-gpu-lib` hold test, qwen38-serve past `46e9bb48` red, GLM e2e/mtp/twocard/serve.
  merge-tree vs `fd8e0bff` conflicts `bind.rs/qwen38.rs/glm.rs` (`4144b1d8`).
- roomone rebased on `fd8e0bff` (worker1 22:5x): tip `a562e31b` (`f1fc06f2`, `014cf537` rrroom; `a562e31b` roomone),
  backup `roomone-pre-fd8=863614cc`. CacheRam keeps `4144b1d8` whole + roomone's checkpoints-inside-need; removed only
  `46e9bb48`'s `a_reserved_need_takes_no_checkpoints_beside_it` (replaced). mac-static `fd8e0bff` ok; box
  `gate-ds41-bind` 19/0 with Compiling. Items 1,2,4,5 → worker1 post-cut round.
- roomone open decision (1): `HostNeed::check` no margin vs `nvme_arena_of` filling room−floor (M, design call).
- roomone open decision (2): other seats/CLIs read room before any hold (ds41 `CacheRam`/`residency41`, `glm.rs:617`,
  `qwen3moe_place.rs:316`, `generate_qwen3moe`/`glm5next`; S each).
- roomone open decision (3): Qwen3.8 seat `--plan` now opens its card (~9 s JIT + ctx VRAM) — behaviour change.
- roomone open decision (4): GLM `Place::machine` public → enforce by type (S–M).
- roomone open decision (5): `gate_qwen38_serve` lacks plan room = load room clause (S).

### What design-t1 left
- design-t1 (opus, 10-09 22:50, `discover/design-t1-report.md`): the tournament's 'h' order breaks a data dependency
  (A's back needs UN(B)); the dependency-correct split re-prices 3090 server pp4096 1,192 → 1,783…2,016 (centre
  ≈1,880) [derived]. `ahead` has no V4.1 caller (GLM's group uses it); `wide38.rs:1942` does not darken a half unit
  (the ring's width test does); no expert-subset union needed. Rounds, all on the train tip after prefill1 lands: R1a
  common pieces no caller (S–M; BatchOrder::Fronts in `sched.rs`, leg unit rows, count scale, xstream share, runtime
  splitwalk rule) → R1b wide38 unit windows, move class (M, ~60 sites) → R1c split walk on (M–L; A/B card
  t1-split-pp predict +36..+47 % prose:4096 A6000) → R2 the walk's price (S–M, only if R1c's untimed arm says
  A-chain binds; +4..+8 %) → R3 T1 with prefill1's return (M). Collides with prefill1 (wide38/xsplit/body38/record)
  and levphase2 (registry phase). = the prompt-side candidate after T3.

### What prefill1 left (worker2)
- `gate_swap.rs:810/715` `staging_threads`/`tids` ENOENT false red (skip NotFound, S): `staging_threads` scans
  `/proc/self/task` and races with exiting threads (ENOENT, rc 1 before s11 on prefill1's m2; base has the same scan)
  — flaky-gate class.
- `swap.rs:3760-3765` pump 256 spins + 20 µs sleep → lane `wait_until` (S–M).
- `lane.rs:400` one `served` counter makes `wait_backlog` count return jobs (per-kind counters, M).
- `body38.rs:3207` first token handed after `stream_end` — overlap the deficit with the handoff (idea, M).

### The tarball pass B (10-09 23:10)
- GLM-5.3-Flash keeps thinking under `reasoning_effort: "none"` (tarball pass B, 10-09 23:10; cause found 10-10 00:15).
  Cause is the model's own template (unsloth shard 1, identical old/new and to
  `crates/serve/tests/fixtures/glm5-chat-template.jinja`): it has NO enable_thinking switch — `<|assistant|><think>`
  always (template line 256) — and its effort header takes low/high, else 'max'. Our `api.rs:2016-2024` maps "none"
  → enable_thinking=false and drops reasoning_effort (llama-server's resolution), so GLM renders "Reasoning Effort:
  Max" + `<think>`: the user asked for no thinking and silently gets max effort. The unit test
  `reasoning_effort_none_turns_thinking_off_on_glm5` (`api.rs:4607`) pins only "none" == enable_thinking:false, which on
  this template is the default. USER DECISION (morning): (a) 400 naming that this template has no off switch (no silent
  failure; may break clients sending "none"), (b) map "none" → the template's lowest effort ("low") with a
  record/warning, (c) leave as llama-server does. Lead recommends (b)+(a)-style warning line.

### The next train (train029b?)
- Next train (train029b?): r4glm `c96d06e0` (`coverage.rs` GLM routed arm → `routed_unrun(card_routed)`; Head pin
  q8_0/q6_K/q4_K; UD-Q3_K_XL passes coverage; 9 CPU/meta gates 9/0; ptx-scan serve identical) + k1iq3s + t3r1 +
  fxr1/fxr2/fxr3 (fxoracle R1–R3 land with R2's sets; fxr3 `314d155b` `site_rel` text-drift test to replace) +
  whatever lands from T1.

### Train shortening: gate-paths (gatepaths2)
- `tools/gate-paths.tsv` lacks narrowing rows for many core files (tracker → worker slot, train shortening):
  `elem.rs`, `crates/model/src/arch/mod.rs` (hotfix: raw 125–127), gpu-gates `tier.rs/flip.rs/act_rule.rs` (fxr3: 98
  for a lib-only add), `crates/model/src/{ops,moe}.rs` + threads `lib.rs` (t3r1: 128, 5,085 s for a ptx-equal move). One
  round derives rows from module trees + which gates exercise each file, FAIL-first by mutation (a row that drops a gate
  catching a planted defect is red). t3r1's drafted rows go to it.
- gatepaths2 (worker1, `6309aac3` on nofixture `490908c5`): reach derivation (`recipes.py` reach), `check-recipes` holds
  every row to it; found 336 gates missing from existing rows (refset clefvis +78, placement +45, `generate.rs` +24,
  serve `build.rs` unmapped); 186 hand-narrowings → named exceptions; 37 new rows. Wall effect 0 [derived] (V4.1 chain
  2,348 + solo pack 2,056 set the 4,577 s wall). Lands after its B sitting (instrument cross-check, ~17 min), in the
  landing after this train.

### The fixture-tier calibration (10-10)
- Calibration finding 2: `crates/model` host tests (`gate-forward`/`attn`/`alloc`) bypass the fence — they opened the
  real V2-Lite in the fixture tier and went green → those greens are real-file greens, not fixture coverage (count
  them so in the comparison). Route `crates/model` tests through the fence or mark them real-file.
- The fence refuses `lev-serve`'s gate-written mock files (`target/lev-serve-gate/{kev,no-decision}.gguf`) → T2 mock
  files cannot live in the fixture tier.
- `gate-gpu-nvtier`, fixture tier: `box.sh` exports the qwen4exp fixture `CARD_BUDGET`, `gate_nvtier` refuses
  `NotActedOn` — pre-existing → worker2 nofixture. The fixture tier run (DONE 00:30): total=136 red=32 (31 logs)
  deferred=78 real_only=30 no_fixture=2, wall 1,080 s (laneA 844, laneB 841, laneX 236). All 31 reds are
  tier-classification gaps, no train regression: 29 NotFixture (real-file kind; list `fx-reds.txt`),
  `gate-gpu-qwen38-residency` (inline exit-66 guard instead of `real-only.sh`), and this one. Next after the fixture
  tier: fxr2 sitting (worker2, started 00:30:54).

### What W3's R8a left (worker3, 10-10)
- **The MXFP4 one-column dot runs under its assumed rate (tracker; profile first).** `qdot-rate` on one pinned core,
  3 rounds (m2-mxfp4-tile sitting, 10-10 04:19Z, loadavg ~13, not a quiet box): `dot_mxfp4_q82x4_avx2` 10.1–10.8 GB/s
  against the 12.3–13.1 the R8 design assumed, and ~5–9 % under ik's `mxfp4_x4_rate` at k = 2048 (10.1 vs 11.1–11.4).
  Still above the 7.8 GB/s break-even, so MiMo's decode host leg stays DRAM-bound and R5 stays next. First step:
  `perf -e cpu-clock` on `qdot-rate`'s MXFP4 rows beside ik's x4 kernel, before any kernel round. The C = 8 tile's
  ratio to the one-column dot is 0.51 (105.0 ns per row-column at k = 4096), so the tile holds; the miss is the base.

### What W3's R9 left (worker3, 10-10)
- **MiMo's default `--parallel` stays 1 (tracker).** The seat serves N resident slots through the common `Slots`
  owner, but MiMo has no one-pass round of several rows, so two slots at the default would only halve each request's
  context. Its default goes to 2, the qwen3/GLM default, once such a round exists
  (`crates/gpu-gates/src/bin/shared/serve_seats/mimo2.rs`, `slots_given`).
- **"No sequence past the plan" lives in three bodies (tracker, after 0210b).** GLM
  (`crates/gpu-glm5next/src/body.rs`, `slots_planned`/`slots_made`), V4.1 (`crates/gpu-deepseek41/src/body.rs`) and
  MiMo (`crates/gpu-mimo2/src/body.rs`) each count the sequences made against the plan's count, and refuse one past it
  in `Slots::new_seq`. It is one rule, so it belongs to `GpuModel::add_slots`
  (`crates/gpu/src/model/slots.rs`), with the planned count given at the load. Size S–M.

## After 0.2.8 (10-09, leader — the post-tag train: paged2, bpslots, levphase, loadchain + packsched, roomneed, stepunion2, binslots)

### What paged1 and pagedoff left
- nvtier columns: the step port's multi-column union (`crates/gpu/src/host/step.rs`, `serve_cols`) reads a paged
  plan's tier ids through the file mapping, not the arena, so a paged plan serves one slot with the draft off and
  refuses a set `--parallel ≥ 2` or draft by name (paged1). Lift: `ExpertStack::matrix` (`crates/model/src/ops.rs`)
  gains the arena lookup, `HostLayer::experts_union_into` (`crates/model/src/moe.rs`) ensures the union's distinct
  tier ids first, `HostRun` passes the arena; bits equal by construction, a MockTier union case against the mapping.
  Part of the 0.2.9 unitier design; then paged1's refusals go. M.

### With rrroom
- `BOX_ROOM` (`crates/gpu-gates/src/qwen38_cards.rs`) and `tools/ref/plan-room.sh` both derive HOST_USABLE − OS_OTHER
  from `crates/placement/src/workstation.rs`: one `pub const` there. XS.

### The paged1 and pagedoff reviews
- nvtier middle band: a room over half the host leg and under its need pages experts with no arena (R1's mapping split; a
  64 GB machine's 58 GiB room). Residency and the column rule both stay as asked there; neither mid vs off nor two
  columns is measured on it. One test-host or box pair under BLOOMERY_HOST_ROOM. S.
- paged-plan box pin: gate_qwen38_serve's paged clause stops at the `parallel` line at `--place gate`, where the draft
  is already off by Gate; the user's case (one small card, place unset → a, the draft turned off by Paged, `load
  draft=off`) has only the test host's log. A box clause at `--place a`, a ~14 GiB room, on the A6000. S.
- paged1 outside items: bp's slot half may over-restrict a paged bp plan (S); generate_qwen3moe drafts unset with no
  arena check (S); the Qwen3.6 seat can page on a small host and should ask paged_columns (S–M); LOAD_DRAFT_OFF38's
  kind doc lists no yield, borrowed or paged reason (XS, next records-refresh).

### The unitier review (worker2)
- `crates/gpu/src/host/swap_source.rs`: `FileSwap::card_bytes` has no caller. XS.
- The serve path prints the nvtier record only at load; a per-call nvtier record (or stats()) for long-lived servers. S.
- The xstream probe prices copies beside union bursts ~1.7× cheap (unitier design). S, measure first.
- `HOST_USABLE` duplicates `HostNeed::check`'s room; one owner. XS–S.
- replan (worker1, design `specs/worker1/replan/design.md` + `levers-census.md`; parked): paste worker1's paragraph verbatim at landing.

### The 0.2.8 release pass
- The #3 fix's pool return costs time where it gains little: on the full A6000 the `call stream end` record times it
  at 0.87 s of a 5,536-token prompt's 4.4 s first token at `--ctx-size 16384` (0.21 s at 538 tokens; `bp` 0.56 s),
  0.19–0.35 s at 40960, where decode stayed in the pre-fix build's ranges; the gain was measured at the RTX 5090's
  card budget. A smaller context leaves the card more experts, so a prompt moves (and returns) more of them. Restore only when the call moved a
  share of the card pool the decode would read (a threshold from the pool's size against the decode's routed set), or
  overlap the return with the first token's step. Release notes and rig-log 10-09#rel028-pass hold the numbers. S–M.

### The Fable reviews of 8f5001a6 (host, plan, serve), routed after the tag

- **nvtier arena floor (host #1a).**
  - The defect: `slots_of` (`crates/gpu/src/host/nvtier.rs:87-99`) refuses only 0 slots. An arena of 1..top_k−1 slots a layer passes the load. Then the first decode step's `ensure` overflows ("every slot is filling: two ensures raced a layer", which is the wrong cause) and poisons the tier `Failed`.
  - When it hits: Qwen3.8 at top_k 10. The band is MemAvailable ≈ floor + 1..10 slot-sets, about 5.7–7.3 GB on the 3090 gate plan [derived], or a small `BLOOMERY_NVTIER_BYTES`.
  - Owner fix:
    - a count floor (top_k, plus the lanes when the machine can run) in `slots_of`/`of_paged`, refused by name at load;
    - `nvme_arena_of` (`placement.rs:2479`) knows the floor;
    - `claim_slots` names "misses > slots in one call" apart from "raced";
    - `NvTierStats` gains slots_per_layer;
    - FAIL-first: a gate_nvtier clause at arena = (top_k−1)·Σslot.
  - Gates: 95 (crates/gpu) or 125 (placement). The paged2 train.
- **nvtier fill vs a reading step (host #1b, structural).**
  - The defect: a lane's victim fill can evict a slot the step is reading when count ≤ the step's ids + lanes. Nothing pins a read slot.
  - 0.2.8 closes the trigger in the seat: a set residency on a paged plan is refused.
  - Structural fix: reading refcount or pin on ensure'd ids.
- **Lane victim fill through the pool's dispatch mutex (host #2).**
  - `NvTier::fill` → `threads::pool().for_each_chunk` runs under the lane's receive lock, so the decode's next dispatch waits on an NVMe read.
  - Fix: read_span on the lane thread, or a lane pool.
  - Add `Pool::stats().dispatch_wait_ns`.
- **Small host-tier items (host #3, #4).**
  - #3: `Body38::stream_begin` drops `call_end`'s error (`body38.rs:3243-3250`).
  - #4: `SwapMachine::boundary`'s early returns consume `end_us` and `call_picked` (`swap.rs:2159-2192`).
- **Checkpoint accounting, one owner (plan F3, serve F6).**
  - Today it is drawn four ways:
    - qwen3/qwen35: a plan reserve;
    - Qwen3.8 (seat reserve since 0.2.8) and GLM: one slot in `CacheRam::of_tier`;
    - V4.1: subtracts 4 GiB it never allocates.
  - Fix:
    - lift to the machine's host reserve row with (slots, has_checkpoints);
    - `CacheRam::of_tier(.., slots)`;
    - the residency38.rs:32-37 doc made true;
    - drop the Qwen3.8 double count in bind.rs:435 once the seat reserve is there.
- **Load check without the arena (plan S4).** Worker2's roomneed (50c71e9c) closes it.
- **Plan S1–S3.**
  - S1: tier `kv_bytes += rows` leaves `headroom_bytes` high by `rows` (`place.rs:408,712,722`).
  - S2: the census context's host bytes vs the room reads.
  - S3: `nvme_arena_of`'s dial is discontinuous at held/2 (0 ↔ room−floor).
- **Serve: ENGINE_STOP vs long prompt calls (serve F4, behaviour).** The prompt walk should read the stop between calls. 0.2.8 fixes only the doc.
- **Serve: halt's error event (serve F5, behaviour).** A stream at SIGTERM ends without an error event or `[DONE]`. 0.2.8 fixes only the doc.
- **Serve: V4.1's `--ctx-size` meaning (serve F8, decision).** ds41 gives 2 slots × the whole ctx; the others give 1 slot. Its `slot_count` should go through `placement::ctx::slots_of`. The user decides.
- **Serve: wrong-type fields ignored (serve F10).** `"stop": 5` and `"stream": "true"` are ignored. max_tokens vs max_completion_tokens precedence: check against llama-server.
- **Sampler factory's Err arm falls back to argmax (`bind.rs:215-224`).** 0.2.8 refuses non-finite input at the API. The arm itself should be a named error.
- **Serve suspects.**
  - S2: GLM's set-ctx refusal does not name NextN bytes.
  - S3: assistant `tool_calls[].function.arguments` reach the template as strings.
  - S4: a mixed round's single pass row bypasses the width chooser (`worker.rs:748-750`).
- **Release check (serve §4).** `tools/release/build.sh` asserts every bug-class commit is an ancestor of the tag, by `git merge-base --is-ancestor`. This catches the paged2-not-in-RC class.
- **bp paged plan (serve F1).** 0.2.8 serves one slot on a bp paged plan. paged2's 9c34cd76/bee691d1 (PagedAt.together) lift it.
  - Note: R1 stepunion2 (worker2) already carries the claim_slots split: a call asking more distinct ids than slots is refused by name before any claim. Still open: the load-time floor and nvme_arena_of.
- **Slots: one KV pool (user, 10-09).**
  - Today the seats split `--ctx-size` statically among the slots: 2 by default, 1 on a paged plan and on a set ctx with no `--parallel`.
  - llama-server's unset `--parallel` is auto: 4 slots over one unified KV pool, its log reading "setting n_parallel = 4 and kv_unified = true" (llama.cpp #17989).
  - Ollama is reported to pick 4, or 1 under memory pressure.
  - A shared pool would drop the static split's loss. It is a candidate after 0.2.9, needing a design round.
- **The 2-slot plan's floor fallback (0.2.8 seatfix):**
  - with the default slots, a HostRoomFloor at 2 slots re-plans at 1 (from=paged);
  - qwen38_place.rs's offer plan has no checkpoint reserve, so on a floor-edge host the offer passes and the load refuses (seatfix out-of-scope #1, 95–129 keys);
  - CacheRam/residency38 still double-count checkpoint_bytes(1) beside the seat's reserve (seatfix #2).

## Top priority: the common-machine gap (GitHub #1, the user, 2026-10-07)

A user measured bloomery 0.2.5 against Strata on one machine and one file: RTX 5090 32 GB, Core Ultra 9 285K (AVX2 +
AVX-VNNI, no AVX-512), dual-channel DDR5, 196 GB, WSL2; Qwen3.8-Flash-Next UD-Q4_K_XL; MTP on; greedy chat, thinking
off; 256 tokens; medians of 3. Strata is ahead 1.6–2.0× on decode (79.0 / 108.5 / 86.4 against 48.8 / 53.0 / 47.4
tok/s at a short, ~3.8K and ~29.6K prompt) and 3.8–7.1× on prefill (1,554 / 2,779 against 407 / 390 tok/s; first token
2.4 / 10.7 against 9.3 / 76.0 s). The machine is the common shape: a strong card and link, a weak host (about half our
147.7 GB/s [derived from the DIMM count]). Our engine was tuned on the opposite shape (8-channel host, PCIe 4.0), so the
goal is one rule that picks per machine from numbers it measures, not a second hard-coded shape. Strata's numbers stay
out of our tables. Sources: the lead's specs `strata/report.md` (agy, Strata `82f46a8c`, mechanisms re-read by the
lead) and the Sonnet cross-check round.

What the code shows (Strata, re-read by the lead):
- Prefill: from a 1,024-token chunk on, every expert the card does not hold streams through a card ring and runs as a
  card GEMM; the CPU computes none (`src/prefill/prefill.cpp:99-115`, `:2540-2572`). Chunks reach 8,192, so the ~60 GB
  stream is paid once per chunk; that is why its rate rises with the prompt.
- Decode verify windows: a share of each layer's distinct missed experts (0.55, scaled by an H2D probe) is read by the
  card over PCIe while the CPU computes the rest (`src/program/generate.cpp:548-551`, `:2355-2368`); misses are read
  once for all rows (`src/core/expert_source.cpp:2620-2650`).
- Draft width: chosen each window from measured round costs by size and an acceptance EMA; no draft unless it beats
  plain by 5 % (`src/spec/controller.cpp:35-55`, `src/spec/draft_policy.cpp`).
- Cache: seeded from an offline profile; every slot adapts, up to 96 swaps every 4 rounds.

Ours: the prefill's host experts run on the CPU, which is about 2.5 ms a token on that host and grows linearly. A
4-row window is fixed, and `Gated` (`crates/runtime/src/gate.rs`) has no caller in the Qwen3.8 seat. Half the card set
is pinned by id prefix (`mid-p57`). The residency clock counts passes, not tokens. The draft holds 933 card experts,
17 % of that card's set. The MTP gain on chat is mostly the genre: our +31…+52 % rows are prose (E = 3.0–3.7), our
chat runs E = 2.17–2.46, and our own W 2.07–2.25 gives −4…+19 % [derived]. The host share of W on his machine is the
second term. His `/metrics` (asked on #1) settle E and W.

| # | Track | Size | Band [derived] | State |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Expert stream, one common owner: a prompt ubatch streams the non-card experts to a card ring and runs card GEMMs, with the host computing a balanced share so both finish together; the threshold and the share come from a load-time H2D probe and the host's measured rate | L | Qwen3.8 at ~4K on the 5090 407 → ~3,700 tok/s ceiling (4096 / 1.1 s), on our A6000 7.4 → ~1.6 s an ubatch; card GEMM not counted, and on his host the staging copies and the CPU share draw on one DRAM | design round `xstream` |
| G2 | The same owner in decode: the card reads a probed share of a window's distinct misses over PCIe | L | miss term 1.25–1.5× on a Gen5 link | in `xstream`'s design |
| G3 | Draft gate and width: wire `Gated` into the Qwen3.8 seat and CLI, and cut a window at a draft probability floor or by a measured cost per width; serve prints the windows' E | S–M | +3…+10 % on his machine's chat, 0 on our prose | round `draftgate` |
| G4 | Residency: count tokens, not passes; un-pin the id-prefix half; size the swap cap from the link | M | hit +2…+4 points | round `resclock` |
| G5 | Rulers for the common shape: a chat-corpus arm in `depth-qwen3moe.sh`, and a "common machine" arm on our box (card budget at his 5,482 experts, host threads capped); read E and W on English chat | S | — | round `chatarm` |
| G6 | A lighter draft (its 2.91 GB back to target experts) | M | +450–600 card experts on 32 GB | after G3 |
| G7 | AVX-VNNI host kernels | M | prefill share only; decode 0 | after G1 |
| G8 | drafted ≠ plain: verify row 0 differs from the plain step by ≥ 0.44 logits at the first divergence (Q4, row 0; Q3 rows 1); the README / `generate_qwen3moe.rs:164` equality claim is false on both files | S–M | — | worker2, opus narrowing |

### The 0.2.6 release: IQ quants and the two-channel host (the user, 2026-10-07; shipped as v0.2.6, open rows moved into 「Release 0.2.7」)

The user: these two lead and go out together.

**Schedule (the user, 2026-10-07 08:10: gatewall first; everything, prefill included, done before 15:00; Claude
rounds allowed freely).** One release train instead of a batch per piece (every `crates/gpu` piece selects the same
~120 gates):
1. iqwire lands alone when its batch ends (~09:00).
2. gatewall (opus `gatewallr`, worker2): lane-A work stealing, per-family arch rows and a `weights.rs` row, every
   functional 3090 pin that is not a public-number fact converted to `any`, AGENTS.md's card paragraph. It moves
   every key, so it lands alone, as soon as it is green.
3. Rounds on `relbase` (main + iqwire + wslfix6b): xstream R2+R3 (`xstream23`) and the profile seed
   (`resprofile`), both opus.
4. 11:30–12:30 sittings on the round trees, the decisive one first: xstream-pp, then the decode cards (resclock,
   draftgate, the wslfix6b A/B).
5. 12:15 cut-off: every piece Mac-green with its owning gates green on its round ledger: wslfix6b, resclock2,
   draftgate, xstreamrule, xstream23, resprofile, ple64r, q3seat. A piece that misses it goes to the next release.
6. One train branch in that order, the check scripts, `records-refresh`, one union batch (`--ledger`). Land all
   (~13:45), release notes, tag (~14:30).
- **IQ quants:**
  - iqwire (Qwen3.8 UD-Q3_K_XL: IQ3_XXS/IQ4_XS gate·up, IQ4_NL down, on the card and the host; landing batch
    running).
  - The Q3 serve-seat refusal (worker1; `Violation::CardOver` in `crates/placement`, the drafted gate plan, 8044 B).
  - ple64 (the 28.8 GB PLE table placed by host room, so a 64 GiB host loads the Q3 file).
  - The iq4xs maddubs saturation stays ik-faithful, banded by its clause.
- **Two-channel host** (rows G1–G5 above), each judged on the common-machine arm as well as our own:
  - G3 draftgate (width by cost, the gate, common across draft families).
  - G4 pieces 1+2, round resclock2: the token clock, and unpinned by default. Replay at a 22 % card share: +4.5…+9.9
    points of hit, decode +2…+4 % [derived]. Piece 3, the engine's own routing profile as the seed: +19…+47 % decode
    on that machine [derived]; the user chose (2026-10-07): the file lives in the user's cache dir (`~/.cache/bloomery/profiles/<model key>`), on by
    default (`BLOOMERY_RES_PROFILE=off` turns it off), one file per model file shared by every seat. It touches
    `host/swap.rs`, so it opens after wslfix6 lands.
    It is the retired corpus-learned list's idea with the in-sample defect removed (the engine's own routing, scored
    held-out). Its remaining risk is that list's: a profile learned on one genre seeding another.
    The cross-genre replay (round `profxgenre`, V4.1 traces prose/code/korean/chat, 16 learn→score pairs, shares
    18 % and 22.3 %, report in the leader's `specs/leader/profxgenre/`): 15 pairs clear the id prefix by +6…+58
    points static. One is below beyond noise: a mixed chat profile on code, −3.1/−3.3 static, −2.2 after 96 tokens,
    −0.7 after 672 (the lead recomputed the static cell independently: 16.3 vs 19.4). The cause is the genre mix in
    one file, not the sample size (chat's code requests alone give +11.8 on code). Neither partial fill (any f) nor
    decay toward recent use (any half-life) clears it.
    **Decision (the user, 2026-10-07): default-on stays; the gate is re-pinned** from "never below the id prefix" to
    "never worse than the measured worst-pair loss": a regression catcher with a `PIN(2026-10-07)` attribution, the
    derivation from that report, and FAIL-first from a deliberately mixed smoke pair. Public rows say "after N
    tokens of own use, held-out".
    Gap: all of this is V4.1. Qwen3.8, the #1 reporter's model, has no second-genre trace. Closing it takes
    `BLOOMERY_ROUTE_TRACE` in the qwen38 seat (resclock §8.2, S) and one chat dump; the piece 3 round carries it so
    the gate covers q38 too (the gate refuses a family with fewer than two genres).
  - G1 phase 1 (xstream R1 rule → R2 lane → R3 Qwen3.8 wiring → R4 sitting): pp4096 +85…+180 % on our A6000, about
    +380…+480 % on the common-machine arm [derived, `xstream` report §3.2, §6]. R2/R3 open after wslfix6 and iqwire
    land (`host/*`, `body38.rs`).
  - G5 rulers (chatarm).
- G2 (decode misses over PCIe) is out of phase 1: about 0 to negative on PCIe 4.0, +8…+15 % on his machine [derived].
- Also in: the 0.2.6 watchdog (wslfix-watchdog). The release asks the #1 reporter to re-run his table on the
  candidate.

## Direction: development speed first (the user, 2026-10-06)

Decisions of 2026-10-07 (the user: "proceed with the recommended defaults"):
- **P4** (clef/qwen3 serve gates to weekly): no, until the wall is re-measured with gatecut in.
- **gate_glm5next_e2e PP list:** no cut. 7, 8 and 9 are a chunk short, whole and one past it (the list's own doc,
  `gate_glm5next_e2e.rs`), so they are distinct boundary cases, not one path proven four times.
- **Kolibri-1:** flagship Q4_K_M + host tier + residency on the A6000 (Q3_K_M whole-card also lands); oracle by
  porting `build_kolibri1.cpp` into an ik tree; Q2_K refused by name in v1.
- **MiMo-V2.6-Flash:** the MOPD checkpoint; all experts on the host first, then card experts; one nextn layer first.
- **Model downloads** (MOPD ~170 GB, Kolibri 37.5 + 47.5 GB) and the llama.cpp mainline re-sit at b11443 are box
  jobs over 30 minutes and wait for the user's approval.
- **Per-step sync sweep:** not now.


Whether development slows down or speeds up depends on code quality, so quality work leads, ranked by how much it
cheapens the next change. Speed and coverage ride the same lever, one common owner per shared concept (AGENTS.md
"Common code first"). The lead tracks these per landing:

| Measure | Now | Way |
|---|---|---|
| Timed gate recipes, sum of last-5 medians | 203, 248 min (`gate-times.tsv`) | down |
| Recipes a `crates/gpu` change selects | 77–119 | down |
| Gate wall of one landing | serve union of 6, 1,770 s (0.2.5) | down |
| Files and lines a new model or format touches outside its own crate | baseline from the GLM-5.3 and Qwen3.8 landings (kolibri1/mimo26 design) | down |
| Rounds lost to a wrong premise or a regression | counted from round reports | down |

Order:
1. **gatecost** (GLM census, running): duplicate clauses, repeated loads, over-selection, and the structural cut
   behind 77–119. Implementation rounds follow its ranked list. Every merge names the gate that still pins each
   contract.
2. Then the files a new model touches outside its own crate. Next are big files by owner (R15), never a kernel or a
   `#[target_feature]` body (R12).
3. **Next models** (the user). Order:
   - Mistral Large 4 "Le Chonk": passed until its open weights are out (due by the end of October; the user,
     2026-10-07).
   - Xiaomi MiMo-V2.6-Flash (`mimo2`, in llama.cpp mainline).
   - Then Aleph Alpha Kolibri-1 (`kolibri1`, a patch beside its GGUF upload, not in mainline).
   - The design reports `mimo26` and `kolibri1` are in. These attachments are also the test of the
     files-outside-its-crate measure.
4. The IQ stacks (iqtrain → iqwire → iqoracle) open Qwen3.8 UD-Q3_K_XL. They are also the kernels the V4-Flash port
   needs (IQ3_XXS + MXFP4).
5. The llama.cpp b11443 speed changes (GLM rounds `lcpp-cuda` and `lcpp-host`). Mainline now runs GLM-5.3 and
   Qwen3.8 MTP, so those two bench rows re-sit against mainline, not a PR branch.

- **Functional gates are card-agnostic** (the user via worker2, 2026-10-07: "the 3090 basis exists mainly to write
  benchmark numbers in public documents; for general gates avoid a specific card and optimize for resources").
  A gate runs on any card it fits, picked by availability. Card-specific plans and pins (`--place gate`, the n3090
  rows) stay only where a public 3090 number is produced. The iqwire batch's remaining wall was the 3090 lock
  (lane A 1,363 s of `gpu-gate.sh 3090` v41-load items, lane X 3,345 s mostly `BLOOMERY_GATE_CARD=3090`, 295 s
  balanced). Order: gatewall's census of card-pinned gates (the fact that pins each, whether a per-card derivation
  replaces it) → one round that converts them and moves AGENTS.md's "the 3090 is the gate-and-build card" line.
- **Gate wall from the iqwire landing batch** (worker2, 2026-10-07; two S items, they move every ledger key, so they
  land between batches):
  - Lock waiting, not running: at 74 of 120 items lane A (3090) had run 2,825 s and waited 2,433 s on the 3090 gate
    lock behind other tracks (`gate-gpu-qwen3moe-rope` waited 726 of its 730 s); lane B waited 1 s. `gate-batch.sh`
    moves a lane-A item to an idle A6000 while the 3090 lock is contended and no timing lease is held, the rule
    `BLOOMERY_GATE_CARD=any` already applies per run.
  - Narrowing over-selects: `crates/model/src/arch/coverage.rs` and `arch/qwen35moe/mtp.rs` map to `*`
    (`tools/gate-paths.tsv:68`), and `crates/gpu/src/weights.rs` has no row. Map them by the family that reads them,
    and give `weights.rs` its row. (iqwire moved kernels, so its full list was right; the `*` rows widen every later
    coverage or mtp change.)
- **Work environment audit** (envaudit, 2026-10-07, the user: "what would a senior Rust/GPU engineer expect";
  lead's specs `envaudit/report-opus.md`). Linking is not the build cost: 138 warm bin builds in trainf took 284 s,
  and the linker is already LLD. The cost is `bloomery-gpu` compiled 6 times per batch, at 134–149 s each.
  - Build variants (XS): `crc32fast`/`indexmap` resolve to `[std]` in some builds and `[default,std]` in others, so
    `bloomery-gpu` and its cuda-* chain build in 3 variants. One edge in `crates/gpu/Cargo.toml` fixes it (branch
    `featedge`, ptx-scan pair running). It avoids 51 compiles in 95 clean batches [derived].
  - cargo-oxide `test` vs `build` rustflags (S fork + M pin move): `passthrough.rs:97-101` gives `test` CargoSelected
    and `build` ReleaseLike, so every test gate rebuilds the whole graph. It avoids 27 compiles. An upstream candidate.
  - A prebuild phase in gate-batch (S–M, after the edge): one build per feature set before the lanes start. It ends the
    cross-lane build-dir lock waits (trainf lane A 427 s; 207 wait lines in 82 batches).
  - Measure `bloomery-gpu`'s codegen (94 % of the unit): host LLVM or device PTX. If device and single-threaded,
    splitting kernels across device crates is the lever (L).
  - compute-sanitizer arm (S–M): memcheck/racecheck/initcheck/synccheck on `gate_kquant`, `gate_iq`, `gate_cand`,
    `gate_hc_gated` in an own remote dir, with a planted-OOB FAIL-first. No file:line yet, because the JIT load passes
    no line-info option and the PTX carries no `.loc`. Fixture e2e arms after R3.
  - Fuzz targets (S, Mac): cargo-fuzz on serve `http::read_request`/`read_chunked`, `template` parse, gguf
    `parse_header`, tool-call parsers. Two defects found by reading are in round `inputfix`: the chunked-size overflow
    (`http.rs:198`) and unbounded nested-array recursion (`gguf lib.rs:1078-1091`).
  - TSan once on `bloomery-threads` (S); loom later (M).
  - Hosted CI (M): fmt, check, the clippy ratchet, the pure and Linux host tests, check-*.sh and deny on a free Linux
    runner. `tools/mac-check.sh` needs a Linux path.
  - Dropped, predicted 0: LTO (its card's band holds 0, `card.py` rc 68), mold, sccache, `-Zthreads`, PGO/BOLT,
    L2 persistence. Debug info only as a separate profile, since device `.loc` lines would move ptx-scan md5s.
  - XS each: `.config/nextest.toml` has no user (delete or adopt); `overflow-checks` per untrusted-input package (not
    profile-wide: overflow MIR breaks device lowering); a rust-analyzer config for the Mac.
  - Done: the lead's pre-push hook (fmt + five fast check-*.sh, 22 s).
- **A graph capture broken by another thread's call on the same device** (worker2, 2026-10-07; S, after 0.2.6).
  - Symptom: `gate-gpu-lib` went red once (eqc2's batch). A context test's second `Gpu::with_device(0)` got 900
    ("operation not permitted when stream is capturing", `lib.rs:2834`, `:2872`), and the concurrent graph test's
    capture failed with 901 (`graph.rs:944`). The capture is THREAD_LOCAL (`graph.rs:92-95`) on a non-blocking stream.
  - The call, by code reading (worker2 and eqc2r; the lead re-read the source): the first stream on a fresh
    `CudaContext` handle runs a context-wide `cuCtxSynchronize` (cuda-core 0.3.1 `simt/context.rs:461-465`, nvlabs-ledger
    row 40). `primary_context` builds a fresh handle for every `Gpu` (`lib.rs:1904-1906`), so creating a `Gpu` on a
    device breaks a capture that another thread is running there. The THREAD_LOCAL mode does not cover a context-wide
    sync. Neither alloc nor module load is the call.
  - Confirm with one box loop: capture on thread A while thread B only runs `CudaContext::new(0)` + `new_stream()`. It
    should give 900/901. With B's stream made before A begins, it should run clean.
  - Engine exposure: any `Gpu` or handle made on a device while that device captures. Check the tier gate's two `Gpu`s
    on one card, a draft model's `Gpu`, a second card's thread, and swap/stage helpers that open their own handle.
  - Fix after the loop, one owner: (a) `primary_context` takes each handle's first stream before any capture can run;
    (b) one handle per device through `ANCHORS` (changes `hw_gpus_on_a_device_hold_their_own_handles`); (c) a fork
    switch for `event_tracking` (a pin move). No test mutex: it would hide the engine's version of the race.
- **`gate-gpu-xstream` hangs intermittently in its drop** (train0210d fixture batch, 2026-10-10; S, 0.2.11). It ended
  rc 124 at 909 s on "XStream drop: the copy stream did not drain"; the rerun was green in 50 s, and the gate-times
  history has an earlier 1088 s row. First question: which copy is still queued when the drop waits (a stats() ring of
  the queued copies at drop), then a FAIL-first that holds one copy in flight across the drop.
- **gpu-gate.sh holds a card lock while it waits for the V4.1 load lock** (xstream23, 2026-10-07; S, after 0.2.6).
  The A6000 then idles (1 MiB in use) while `any` items fall back to the 3090 queue. Round gate items waited 20+ min
  each. The order is deliberate (`tools/gpu-gate.sh` self-test "lock order": a load queued on its card lock holds no
  V4.1 load lock), so reversing it moves the idle to the other lock. Fix: take both locks together, retrying with
  non-blocking `flock -n` on each and holding neither while waiting. FAIL-first: a held load lock leaves the other
  item's card free for an `any` item.
- **gate-batch has no clean stop** (worker2, 2026-10-07, iqwire's stop; S, after 0.2.6).
  - The main process writes no pid file, and lane X runs inside it. A stop through pid files can only TERM
    `lane-X.child`, and each TERM starts the next item.
  - A killed Mac `just` does not reach the box. 17 remote chains outlived the stop, as lock waiters and box.sh wrappers
    in `lease_guard`. `box-gc` reported 0 because it selects only `target/` executables. One gate then took its locks
    and started on both cards before it was killed.
  - Fix: write `$$` to `OUT/batch.pid`. Have stop() end each item's remote chain through a remote pid file per item.
    Have `box-gc` also select processes whose cwd is the track's remote dir (lock waiters, wrappers).
  - FAIL-first: a stopped fixture batch leaves no remote process.
- **Fixture tier (test doubles; the user, 2026-10-07: "네 추천대로 진행해줘")**. The design is the lead's specs
  `fxdouble/report-opus.md` and its addendum. Small fixture models force offloading and load warm in about 2–3 s
  [derived]. That moves whole-model gates out of the solo lane: the landing wall goes from 6,741 s to about 2,600–2,800
  s [derived]. Three hosts: the box (real files), the test host and the small-card host (fixtures, planned with pick `a`; the small-card host is the
  baseline, a 4060 8 GB with 16 GB RAM). The Qwen3.8 fixture is 4 layers, about 8.9 GB [derived].
  - Rounds: R0 `fxcommon` (one family-agnostic generator; running) → R1 `fxq38gen` → R2 `fxtier` (tier in the ledger
    key) and R8 `fxhost` (one runner for the small-card host and the test host, host in the key), both after the 0.2.6 tag and gatewall,
    since both edit `gate-batch.sh` → R3 `fxq38gates` → R4 `fxroute`, R5 GLM, R6 V4.1, R7 the fixture oracles. None
    rides the 0.2.6 train.
  - Approved: about 12 GB on /models for R1; R3's real-file run past 30 min. R5/R6's real-file runs (GLM 34–94 min,
    V4.1 about 33 min) are not covered by this approval: ask when they come up.
  - Release batches become R-a: the fixture tier plus real-only arms (about 65 min [derived]), with self-consistency
    clauses on real weights moved to `just weekly`. The first release after the tier lands runs R-a and R-b (all real,
    about 112 min) both. A red only in R-b is a fixture gap to close before R-a stands alone.
- **IQ types on the threaded host leg have no gate** (worker2, 2026-10-07; after 0.2.6, S). No gate in iqwire's batch
  runs IQ3_XXS/IQ4_XS through `moe.rs`'s threaded host leg. `gate-moe` has no IQ type. The qwen4exp/qwen38 e2e gates
  load UD-Q4_K_XL, whose routed stacks hold no IQ type. qdot's tests pin the IQ dots, but serially. So iq-sel-2's
  harness mutant cleared only that one defect; it is not a race check of the leg. The only evidence today is
  functional: dprober's plain = drafted ids, 32/32 on the Q3 file at residency off. That is weak, not a check. Close
  it with a real-file arm of `gate-gpu-qwen4exp-e2e` on the Q3 file, with host experts, run twice and bit-equal.

- **WSL2 one-queue boundary cost** (worker1, wslfix, derived from `stage_us`): under one hardware queue the readback
  after a planning boundary waits behind that boundary's staging and HtoD, once per 4 steps. That is about 5–7 ms on
  Qwen3.8, 24–35 ms on GLM and 32 ms on V4.1. It is a decode cost, not a hang. Open: measure it on the test host, and decide
  whether the boundary staging can move off the readback's queue.

## 리드 시팅 큐 (임대 자리, 각 ≤ 30분, 빌더 틈에 하나씩 — 둘을 연달아 붙이지 않는다)

1. **E21** 3090 실측, 공개 파일(사용자 승인 09-24): `BLOOMERY_TIMING_GPU=<3090>` `--place gate`(기본 배치, 빈도 목록은 09-30 삭제), 깊이 6/4096, prose·code 512, n 96, 2바퀴; 같은 자리에 llama.cpp·ik·ik + DSpark(n_max 5, `--temp 0`) + **N5 ik 플래그 세트 3–4개**(ik의 공개 파일 최적 플래그를 찾은 적이 없다 — `-ncmoe 33`부터). 예측(N6) 33–38 tok/s; 24G 흉내는 35.8이었다.

6. **P** 프리필 기준선(사용자 09-25, `ed3d6f3` 뒤) — 한 자리에 모으면 30분을 넘어[유도] 셋으로 나눈다. 벽시계는 V4.1 적재 ≈ 60 s, 우리 V4.1 ≈ 40 tok/s, mainline 워밍업이 전체 프롬프트라 lcpp 팔은 프롬프트를 두 번 돈다는 가정의 [유도]다.
   - ~~우리 V4.1 팔은 빈도 목록을 켠다~~ 09-30: 목록 레버를 삭제했다(사용자). 우리 팔은 기본 배치로 돈다(09-25 L3 산문 쌍은 목록 없이 33.9 ms, 09-24 목록 켬 23.3 ms).
   - 읽을 때 비대칭 넷(러너 헤더): ik 워밍업은 1토큰·mainline은 전체 프롬프트라 `-r 1`의 ik·우리 행에 첫 접촉 비용이 든다; 우리 Qwen3 프리필 아레나가 벽시계 안(q3graph 카드); 우리 Qwen3 캐시 높이는 D + N을 256으로 올림, llama-bench는 n_ctx = P; V4.1 우리 `kind=steps`는 스텝률 이상. 설계 예측(M3): ik ub 512 140–195, 실측이 f_ik ≈ (1000/pp − 0.45)/8.65를 주고 그것이 hosttile의 목표다. 프로필의 lcpp는 `-nopo 1`(호스트 expert를 호스트에서)이라 설계의 op 오프로드 예측(40–46)과 다른 경로다.
7. **C** 깊이 1024·4096 merge(hcfin은 세그먼트 수 비례) + m=5 프리필 행(`ds41_attn_merge` blk/SM 3 → 1의 파동 증가).

7. `ds41router-a3`(181e2f6 = 옛 base + A3): A3 hunk를 main에 리베이스한 뒤 base/A3 두 팔, 깊이 6·1024·4096; 이기면 `_sel` 스필 8 B를 `PIN`으로 래칫에 적고 머지.
8. shadowhost A/B(base `~/repo/bloomery-shadowhost-base`): A base 무예산 / B 새 트리 `BLOOMERY_CARD_BUDGET=49610227712` / C 새 트리 무예산, 기대 ≤ 0.5 % — A/A 팔, 바퀴 많이.
9. 합집합 벤치: `just time-cpu-v41-host --threads 32 --rounds 3 --seconds 24 --warmup 3 --arms engine:3,engine:3x4,engine:3x4u0.75,engine-sep:3x4u0.75,engine:3x3`(오늘 행별 호출이 둘째 읽기를 L3에서 받는지) + `e644f5a`의 `union:` 팔 — `--arms engine:3x6u0.75,engine-sep:3x6u0.75,union:3x6u0.75`(토큰당 ms ≈ union_bytes / 135 GB/s ± 5 %; 예측 630 슬롯 → 474 distinct, 78.3 → 58.9 ms[유도]; 1.15배 넘게 느리면 defer 몫 먼저). `--time`의 토큰 루프는 아직 한 번도 안 돌았다.

11. 작은 것들: E5b(우리 greedy 출력에 `draft-accept.py`, 3분) → E19(lookup 게이트 정책, 오프라인); ~~E17(빈도 목록의 프롬프트 의존, 오프라인 10분) → E18 여부~~(09-30 목록 삭제로 닫음); E29 DSpark 수락률의 온도(`--temp 0/0.7/1.0`, 15분); E9 engram 콜드 팔 + N3(Q3_K engram 표 84.6 GB의 페이지 캐시 잔류: E1b·E9·E20 한 자리); E14 0층 브리지 2.1–2.7 ms + J2 브리지 분해(A6000 nsys 행, `nsys-bridge.py`); E7 3090 250 W 아래 실효 BW(`bench-gpu-kernels`); K2 절편/기울기(`bench_v41_host --arms read-mmap:3,read-mmap:6,engine:3,engine:6` 16T·32T)·K3(`perf stat`, `THREADS=64`, THP)·K8(16 대 32 스레드); R4 `BLOOMERY_SPIN` 20000(×2 A/A)·200000·2000000, 산문 512, 4바퀴; N1 공개 파일 카드 크기 곡선 세 점 다시(~25분); N2 공개 파일 `nsys-gpu-ds41 512` 한 행(작은 런치가 노출의 주인인지); dsgraphc `propose` eager 대 graph(같은 바이너리 팔); qwen3route 뒤 E28 재측정.
12. **Q3X** qwen3prefill 크로스오버(P ≥ 9[유도]): `generate_qwen3moe --prefill pass|gemm`을 P 8·9·16에서 같은 자리, 약 5분[유도]. 예측은 P 9에서 pass 두 번 ~25.6 ms 대 GEMM ~22 ms, P 8은 같음.

- q3graph 남긴 것: **조용한 실패 먼저** — `crates/gpu/src/q4k_sel.rs:89`·`q6k_sel.rs:76`(a5gemm이 셋째를 찾음: `lib.rs:1733` `q3k_gemv_sel`)이 `id >= n_experts`면 그 슬롯의 `y`를 안 쓰고 넘어가 combine이 낡은 행을 읽는다 → fault word(라우터가 범위를 보장하는지 먼저 확인, 다음 fixup 첫 항목, S). `model.rs:283-285` `Residency { weights, body }` 순서라 body 안 그래프가 주소 원천보다 늦게 파괴된다(R25, 모든 아키텍처, XS); `model.rs:265-270` `Stage`가 `gpu`를 `graph`보다 먼저 선언(XS); `model.rs:705` `seed_depth` 문서 "There is no prefill kernel"이 qwen3moe에는 틀림(XS); `prefill.rs:194` 프롬프트마다 이미지 H2D 동기 → pinned 스테이징(XS); `gpu/src/lib.rs:2610` 외 약 8곳 열 상한 1..=8 손 반복 → const 하나(R6) 또는 열 act·슬롯 act 타입 분리(R2, XS–S); `lib.rs:2109` quantize가 호출마다 prepare(XS); `depth-qwen3moe.sh:497` `capture` 줄이 둘(정보용, `nodes` sed는 여전히 한 줄에만 맞음, XS). m > 1 접기(`dispatch.rs:377,415`, 약 144노드 −0.12 ms/패스[유도])는 **norm+router만** 후보 — 양자화를 커널 안으로 접는 것은 qwen3fuse에서 +0.13 ms씩 손해로 실측됐다(rig-log 09-25#qwen3fuse-regression-nsys).
- prefillbench 남긴 것(러너): `depth-qwen3moe.sh`에 `guard_cpu`가 없어 행이 CPU 경합을 못 적는다(S–M); 같은 파일 `:268` `tree_line`에 ds41 쪽의 box.sh 커밋 폴백이 없다(S); 두 러너가 ~200줄(`tree_line`·회전·dry·평균 awk·`ratio_table`)을 복사해 갖고 있다 → 공유 헬퍼 하나(M, 러너 라운드 하나로 셋을 함께); ik pp 워밍업 비대칭 → `-r 2 -oe jsonl`의 `samples_ns[1]`을 읽는 레버(S–M, 시팅 P 결과를 보고). 버림: `cstate-ab.sh:26` KEEP 패턴이 `time prompt`도 남김(무해), lcpp dry 줄 이중 공백(기존). 업스트림 후보(§12): mainline CUDA op 오프로드 문턱 32(`ggml-cuda.cu:5528-5547`)가 MoE 희소성을 안 보고 512토큰마다 cold expert 전부를 복사한다(09-14에 166 GB 관찰) — ik 규칙 `batch × n_active ≥ 32 × n_total`(ik `ggml-cuda.cu:5227-5256`)이 닫는다; 시팅 P-a/P-b의 lcpp 행이 증거가 된 뒤 중복 이슈·PR 전수 검색부터(S).; 팔 하나가 행을 못 내면 `depth-ds41.sh`가 남은 팔·바퀴를 버리고 rc 1로 멈춘다 → 끝까지 돌리고 마지막에 rc(S, P-b가 2바퀴를 잃음); ub를 키운 llama.cpp V4.1 팔은 `--n-cpu-moe`를 같이 올리는 문법(S)
- slots 남긴 것(서버, 작음): `genloop.rs:316` `partial_path`가 프로세스 단위라 한 프로세스의 서버 둘이 같은 디렉터리에 동시에 save하면 충돌(원자 카운터, S); `http.rs:33,41` `has_query`·`query_value` 퍼센트 디코딩 없음(S); `model/tests/common/oracle.rs:21-38,142,170`이 `head`·`derived` 타깃에서 dead-code 경고(`just check`, S); 테스트 안 된 경계 셋 — 빈 슬롯 save(40 B), `File::create` 실패 500, 퍼센트 인코딩 `action`. 버림: ik 전용 엔드포인트(`/slots/list`·`/delete_prompt` 등) — 호환 기준은 mainline이다.

15. **MUT** mutpilot(위 도구 절) — 빌더 없는 자리, CPU만 쓰므로 GPU 시팅과 겹쳐도 되지만 union 벤치(H1)와는 겹치지 않는다. 설치는 네트워크(`cargo install`).

## 사용자 결정 대기

- **hostone C의 비열등 팔(aa 서명 조건 12, 09-27).** C 단계(디코드를 union 호출로)는 카드가 잣대 아래라 시간 A/B 없이 T1–T7과 비트 게이트로 착륙하는 안이다. AGENTS의 "디스패치 경로 변경은 같은 임대 A/B"와 부딪히므로 C를 띄우기 전에 묻는다: 이미 잡힌 V4.1 시팅에 비열등 팔(여유 = 4라운드 잣대)을 얹을지, 구조 시험만으로 갈지.

- **SWA Bounded Replay**(V4.1 프리필 근사 모드, 논문 arXiv 2609.19969 §3.2.2): 디코더 층을 프롬프트 마지막 128토큰에만 돌린다 — 논문이 "수학적으로 같지 않다"고 적고 후학습에서 같은 재생을 흉내 내 적응시킨, DeepSeek의 배포 최적화. 정확한 CED 삼각형(2,560토큰, ds41batch에 기본으로 넣는다) 위에 P ≫ 2,560에서 디코더 몫을 더 깎는다. 켜면 ik 오라클과는 비트·밴드가 아니라 KL로 비교해야 하고 출력이 바뀐다 — 레버로 둘지, 기본으로 할지, 안 할지.

- **공개 시점**(M1 숫자만 vs M2와 함께). LICENSE는 MIT 유지로 정했다(2026-09-25; 옮겨 온 코드 전부 MIT, Apache-2.0은 의존성 cuda-oxide·cuda-core뿐, notices에 cuda-core 항목 추가).
- **시팅 10과 혼합 파일 삭제 시점**(결정 2026-09-25, 리드 추천대로): 시팅 10 **승인** — 파동 22 착륙 뒤 빌더가 없는 밤 자리에 CPU 잡 셋(`ik-greedy-ds41`, `ik-ppl`, `build-ref-dump-draft`)을 한 자리로; 재생성된 셋으로 `gate-gpu-dspark-graph`·greedy·ppl 게이트가 공개 파일에서 녹색이 된 커밋 뒤에 혼합 파일·`MIXED`·그 오라클 세트를 지운다. (09-27 실행: 4분 42초로 끝났다. 승인 조건은 "빌더가 없는 밤 자리"였다. 그 시각에 빌더 라운드 하나(records)가 살아 있었지만, 증인의 CPU 압력은 0이었고 박스에서 빌드는 돌지 않았다. 03의 라운드 넷은 5시간 넘게 멈춰 있었다.)
- **Expert Deferral(손실 기법)**(결정 2026-09-25): 무손실 레버(dsloop·union 계열)가 소진된 뒤 재검토하고, 같은 임대 A/B(A6000, 산문 512)에서 tok/s 이득이 **5 % 이상**이면 **옵트인 레버**(기본 off, 정확도 게이트 동반)로 넣는다; 5 % 아래면 닫는다.
- **다운로드 둘**(결정 2026-09-25): EAGLE-3 체크포인트(lmsys SpecForge-Nex 0.2B)는 **받는다**(작고, qwen3spec ④와 "투기 대 투기" 공개 비교의 재료); Qwen3-30B-A3B IQ4_XS는 **IQ 커널이 착륙한 뒤**(시팅 D → IQ 라운드) — 커널 작업의 재료는 박스에 있는 Coder-Next IQ4_XS로 충분하다.
- **DFlash 대상**(결정 2026-09-25): **Coder-30B-A3B의 공개 드래프터에 얹는다**(코드 τ 6.4–8.1); 드래프터 학습은 열지 않는다(학습 파이프라인 없음, 주 단위).
- **V4 R0 전체 덤프(128 GB 페이지인)와 `v4time`(각 > 30분)**(결정 2026-09-25): 둘 다 **승인**, 밤 자리 하나씩 — R0 덤프는 시팅 10·E21 뒤, `v4time`은 v4meta 사슬(v4card·v4comp·v4hc·v4idx·v4body)이 착륙한 뒤.
- **3090을 expert 전용 카드로(N4, 지금 (b′)) · CPU head 묶음 타일(㉖, float 순서 M–L)**: N4는 twoeng 설계가 +8–12 %[유도]로 다시 매겼고(보류 목록 기준 plain 40.7 → 44.0, DSpark 45.7 → 50.3), 코드 라운드로 돈다 — R1 `tierplan`·R2 `tierslots`·R4 `tierbatch`는 aa, R3 `tierkern`·R5 `tierwire`는 e1(순서는 아래 「두 카드 (b′)를 앞으로」). ㉖은(결정 2026-09-25) **보류**(float 순서 변경, CPU 티어는 V4.1 카드 경로의 임계가 아님 — 카드로 남긴다).

- **down 활성값 q8_2_x4 → q8_K**(cpugemm-lit 09-25): 호스트 union을 DRAM 바닥(c ≤ (W − a)/m̄ = 11.3 µs)에 붙이려면 down의 Q4_K × q8_2_x4를 q8_K 활성값으로 바꿔야 한다(mainline의 Q4_K vec_dot_type; 약 27명령/256 MAC, c ≈ 12.3 → a 30 + 12.3 × 7.6 = 123.5 < W = 126.4 [유도]). 행-레인 타일(h3tile)만으로는 t(7.6) ≈ 151 µs = 1.19 W라 계산 바운드가 남는다. 대가: Q4_K/Q5_K 경로의 반올림이 디코드까지 바뀌고(ik 8레인 float 누산·`hsum_float_8` 순서와 갈림), 비트 게이트 재핀(PIN + 밴드), ik 패리티 상실 — 「Performance first, accuracy opt-in」에 맞는 방향이지만 오라클 기준이 바뀌는 결정이라 사용자 몫. 기본 추천: h3tile(비트 동일)을 먼저 착륙시켜 c 15.9를 실측한 뒤, 그 실측이 예측 안이면 q8_K 라운드를 연다.

- **모델 축의 순서**(결정 2026-09-25, 사용자 "지금은 일단 deepseek 4와 4.1 그리고 qwen 최신 모델 지원에 집중"): 모델 축은 **V4.1(프리필 사다리, 지금) → V4-Flash 포트(v4meta 사슬) → Qwen 최신**(Qwen3-30B-A3B는 됨; 다음은 조사 `models-survey.md`의 Qwen 줄 — Qwen3 dense·Coder-Next/Qwen3-Next)이고, **GLM-4.7-Flash·GLM-5.3-Flash(`glm5next`)는 보류**(카드는 남기고 파동에 넣지 않는다).


사용자 결정(2026-09-28 아침, "응 그렇게 하자" — 리드 제안 여섯 줄을 그대로 수락):

- **Qwen3.8 tiered requant**(자주 쓰는 expert는 비트를 올리고 드문 것은 내려 72 GB에 통째로 넣는다. 3×3090 공개 23 → 79–92 tok/s + MTP, 대가는 KLD 0.045 → 0.091): **보류.** KLD 두 배는 반올림 규칙이 아니라 모델 품질 손실이고, 파일이 달라져 llama.cpp와 같은 파일 비교가 깨진다. 두 카드 raw 실측을 먼저 보고, 그 뒤에도 필요하면 KLD를 표기한 별도 파일로만 낸다.
- **K7 선택 폭: `top_k + 3` = 2,051칸(ik·mainline·Strata와 같게).** 「Performance first, accuracy opt-in」: 좁은 쪽이 싸고 공개 비교선·ik 오라클과 같다. 풀 전체 + 꼬리는 `exact_ref`의 팔로만 남긴다.
- **`Body38::ALLOWED` still lists `pre-tokenizer qwen35`** (`crates/gpu/src/arch/qwen3moe/body38.rs`, XS): the item left the coverage list when the tokenizer gained the qwen35 pre-tokenizer (2026-09-30), so the entry is dead. Remove it with the next change to `crates/gpu`, which moves every GPU gate's key anyway.
- **qwen4exp MTP gate, what the node-local pins leave open** (mtpfix; window D, `12789ca8`):
  - The windows' proposals are not pinned (S). Under app mutant 02 (the anchor reads its hidden row one past its own)
    every greedy and store clause of (w) passes: verify keeps the ids the plain run's whatever the draft proposes. It
    turned red only through the lane-word clause's refusal. A clause holding each window's proposed ids to a host-fed
    walk's, as `prompt_walks` does for the prompt call, catches a proposal defect directly; the same clause holds the
    catch-up's last-row token swap, which today moves only the accept rate.
  - Three links have no node pin (S): AttnIn → AttnGated (the attention core), FfnIn → the router's ids and weights,
    FfnIn → `rh`/`sh_h` (gate·up·SwiGLU). Only the ik catchers ((h) argmax, (l) flips) hold them. The `rh`/`sh_h` taps
    exist, so a SwiGLU pin is the cheapest close.
  - `MtpNode::at` is private (`crates/gpu/src/arch/qwen3moe/mtp38.rs`), so the gate re-derives `node_at` (XS).
- **Qwen3.8 serve's draft hooks** (mtpfix): `before_step` is a serve-only calling convention; a before-step hook on
  the `Draft` trait removes it (`crates/app/src/arch/qwen3moe/mod.rs` `stepped`, S–M). `gate_qwen38_serve.rs`'s
  `join_of` is the one place Rust parses a record line; a kind reader in `record.rs` keeps records to one owner (S).
  `crates/gpu-gates/src/bind.rs:842` could say that an empty prefill never reaches the Seat (XS).
- **V4.1 server: the prompt stream's early edge is small, and the server prints no call records** (resvideo sitting,
  2026-09-30, `4e77f89b`; data in the lead's specs `release/resvideo/pack/`). Under `generate_ds41` on prose P 512 the
  streaming arm's first 16 passes run at 41.5 tok/s against the rule arm's 27.1 (card hit 0.57 against 0.23); under
  `bloomery-serve-ds41` on the 507-token RateLimiter review its first 50 tokens run at 31.6 against 27.8, although its
  TTFT (3,061 against 2,636 ms) shows the call streamed. The server prints `residency pass` records but not `call
  stream` or `call stream end`, so which of the chat template, the code prompt or the call's kept picks explains it
  cannot be read from its log. First step: print the call records from the server as `generate_ds41` does (S), then
  rerun one tape pair.
- **`tools/ref/depth-ds41.sh` `keep_out` keys an arm's kept log by label and round, not P** (XS): two P of one arm
  label overwrite each other (resvideo: each timed arm kept P 512 of round 2 and P 4096 of round 1 only). Add P
  to the file name and a stub case with two P of one label.
- **Qwen3.8 레버 순서: 배치 프리필 → 두 카드 residency → raw Q5_1 → MTP.** 격차가 pp 쪽(llama.cpp의 약 0.3배)이 decode(약 0.9배)보다 크고 프리필은 헤드라인 축이다. Qwen3.6의 ubatch GEMM 경로 재사용 여부가 첫 라운드의 종이 분해 항목이다.
- **출시 범위**: 네 모델(V4.1·Qwen3.6·GLM·Qwen3.8) 모두 싣는다. Qwen3.8은 진 숫자 그대로, 캡션에 이유(호스트 전용 경로, 배치 프리필 없음). GLM은 "깊이 ≤ 2k" 캡션, hot 행은 하한.
- **down 활성값 q8_K: 위 기본 추천대로.** h3tile(비트 동일)을 먼저 올려 c를 실측하고, 실측이 예측 안이면 q8_K 라운드를 연다.

- **적응형 residency를 지금 병렬 트랙으로**(사용자 2026-09-28 "네 제안대로 할게 잘 고민해서 진행해줘"; 근거 03 `ideaverify`, `specs/wave-m8/reports/ideaverify.md` §1 — 트레이스 재생에서 V4.1 적중 정적 cross 39–50 % / in-domain 64–77 % 대 적응형 mid 78–81 %, GLM 49.1 대 63.4 %, 스왑 토큰당 2.1–5.2개): GLM 순서는 **DSA 선택기 ‖ 배치 프리필 ‖ 적응형 residency → MTP k = 1 → 두 카드**로 바뀐다. 세 모델(V4.1·GLM·Qwen3.8)이 한 메커니즘(호스트 규칙 + `SlotMap` 이동 중 상태 + 스테이징 링)을 쓰고, 설계 라운드 `adaptres`(Mac, 읽기 전용)가 결정적 비트 계약과 공정 측정 규칙(시간 창은 정적 시드에서 시작)까지 정한다. 전제 하나: 생성 텍스트 트레이스. 정정(09-28, 03): `router-gen.card`는 돌리지 않고 버렸고, 라운드 `routetrace`의 d2-chat 트레이스(엔진 자신의 라우팅, 채팅 48개 프롬프트의 greedy 응답)를 `router-residency.py gen`으로 재생한다.
- **웜업·공정 재측정**(사용자 2026-09-28): 모든 엔진의 공개 행은 웜업 상태에서 `docs/fair-measure.md` 계약대로 잰다. 재측정 시팅은 GLM 배치 프리필과 Qwen3.8 개선이 착륙한 뒤("glm의 프리필과 qwen3.8의 개선이 명확해진 다음에 재자").

- **두 카드 모양과 아키텍처 원칙**(사용자 2026-09-28 "네제안대로 할게 나는 심플하여 지속가능하면서도 성능 좋은 아키텍쳐를 원해"; 근거 `twoeng` 설계, `specs/wave-r3/reports/twoeng.md`): GLM의 두 카드 모양은 **(b′)**(3090 = expert 전용 층, 호스트 티어에 매단다)로 V4.1과 같게 한다. 호스트가 병목이고 카드 몫이 낮은 모델(V4.1 f 0.18–0.28, GLM 0.23–0.37)은 3090 다리가 호스트 다리 그늘에 든다. Qwen3.8(f 0.86–0.98; 정정(09-28, `q38streamd`): 4096 ubatch arena가 카드마다 2.77 GB를 잡아 43층 0.90, 48층 0.79 [유도])은 (b) 층 분할을 유지한다. 원칙: 한 가지 일에 기제 하나를 모델이 공유하고, 모델별 차이는 어댑터로만 둔다. 슬롯 표·교체 규칙·두 카드 조각(둘째 `Gpu`, 매핑 핸드오프 페이지, 폴트 합치기, 카드 상실 감시, `Place`)이 그 공유 기제다. 예측[유도]: V4.1 두 카드는 +8–12 %(held-out 평문 40.7 → 44.0, DSpark 45.7 → 50.3)이고, 적응형 residency는 한 카드에서 +29 %로 더 큰 레버다.
- **두 카드 (b′)를 앞으로**(사용자 2026-09-28 "나는 두 카드에 전문가를 나눠담는 기능이 당장 필요해 toktape에 필요한것 우선순위 높혀줘"): V4.1 두 카드 사슬(twoeng R1 `tierplan` → R2 `tierslots` → R3 `tierkern` → R5 `tierwire`, R4 `tierbatch`는 pplbrec 뒤)이 적응형 residency와 MTP보다 먼저 간다. `tierslots`는 `slotstate`에서 다시 떼어 먼저 착륙하고, `slotstate`가 그 위로 리베이스한다. 속도로는 두 카드가 +8–12 %이고 적응형 residency가 +29 %다[유도, twoeng]. 그래서 이 순서는 속도가 아니라 제품(toktape 클립) 결정이다. 첫 클립은 R5 뒤에 찍는다(프롬프트는 스텝 공급, TTFT 약 6.8 s @ 300토큰 [유도]). 둘째 클립은 R4 뒤에 찍는다. 담당은 R1·R2·R4 aa, R3·R5 e1이다(aa 확인 대기).
- **탐침 시팅 승인**(사용자 2026-09-28, e1 경유 "run both"): train 7 뒤 `iktwo`(ik 두 카드 최적, 내부 기준선, 약 24분)와 03의 탐침 시팅(`specs/wave-m8/sitting-03-after-train7.md`, 약 76–141분 + `q38hostq51` 1b 약 10분, 항목마다 ≤ 30분). 헤드라인 웜업 재측정만 Model-Optimizer 조사를 기다렸고, 그 보류는 skip-softmax(손실 기법, 사용자 판단 대기) 하나를 빼고 풀렸다(아이디어 원장). e1의 연구 시팅(`probecard`, 100–130분)도 사용자 승인.

남은 사용자 결정: **공개 시점**(M1 숫자만 vs M2와 함께).

## 열린 항목 — 받을 라운드별

### After 0.2.3 (10-06, leader — the 18:00 restart; owners leader, worker1, worker2)

v0.2.3 is 2647030c. Everything below is 0.2.4 work. The handoffs it was read from: the lead specs
`line1-handoff-2026-10-06.md`, `line3-handoff-2026-10-06.md`, `multiseq2/carry-forward.md`, `leader/intake-2026-10-06.md`.

**leader**
- Vision landing, in order: visinj (de979fe3) → visref (284d3304) → visserve (f55d7aa8). visinj's ptx-scan of
  `generate_ds41` and `gate_e2e` equals 2647030c (267 and 196 entries); its gates and visserve's gate-serve run in
  line3's runner.
- q38tslots (GLM round, tree bloomery-q38tslots): review when it ends. Its spec predates f2593a62: TIER_LAYER_NODES is
  9, so its clause (c) reads 9·t + 1.
- Remove the worktrees that landed in 0.2.3 and their box dirs.

- **parkfix (closed, db3a78d8):** the q38tslots red was its harness (no `select_slot` after `verify_slots`); the mtp
  gate now holds a parked slot's plain steps after a partial keep. q38tslots (WIP 88116629): add
  `s.select_slot(slot)?;` before its STEPS loop (`gate_qwen38_twocard.rs:1240`), rebase, read clause (c) as 9·t + 1.
- **slot-select guard (0.2.5, half a round, a crates/gpu train):** after a pass of several slots the model leaves slot
  0 selected silently, and a single-slot call then runs on slot 0 — a defined wrong output. Refuse it by name until
  `select_slot` (also on the no-op path, `model/slots.rs:441`); ~15 gate files add a `select_slot(0)`. Serve is
  unaffected (genloop clears its selection).

**worker1 — placement and Qwen3.8 serve**
- placeunset: one common rule for an unset `--place` (the user, 10-06). Design final in the lead specs
  `release/placeunset/report.md`: keep a tier only when the plan's next-card tier experts reach the family's
  break-even and exceed 0. V4.1 bp has never been sat; `docs/cards/v41bp-ab.card` predates f2593a62.
- The q38big bugs still open (0fee5846 closed q1 DraftReserve, q2 the idle-tier misreport, q4 NoHostExperts, q5 the
  idle tier's eligible layers and q6 Borrowed): q3 an empty host tier is built anyway (`body38.rs:1159-1211`, a
  q38tslots file); q7 the test census's free_bytes; q8 rank by free. The placeunset report's "bp + draft refuses on
  DraftReserve" is stale for the same reason.
- Qwen3.x's unset whole load opens `Gpu::new()`, device 0 (`qwen3.rs:458,535`; the probe `qwen3moe_place.rs:680`,
  `:715`, `:741`, `:900`), not `a`'s largest card: on two cards in another order it can land on the smaller one. Needs
  a crates/gpu public constructor by device. M.
- q38big (c): an empty host tier still costs about 48 round trips a step on a 96 GB card.
- q38tslots-ab: re-derive with the tier copy-out (~800 KB a layer at 8 columns, 30–40 µs [derived]).
- Copy-out packing: the tier copies all n_used·cols·hidden; packing only the tier slots' rows is S, ~60 lines.
- q38bp long steps: bp's mean is 1.008 ± 0.047 of a while p50 is 3 % shorter in every round; the long-step source is
  unread (rig-log 10-06#q38bp). GLM bp +13 % was measured before the tier fix; V4.1 c_two (1.9–2.5 ms a pass) may be the
  same mapped-store term.
- Qwen3.8's drafted sampled clause (`gate_qwen38_serve.rs` `sampled_served`) runs only under BLOOMERY_DRAFT=mtp, which
  the recipe's server does not set: it has never run. Add an arm or a recipe.
- num3090run (tree, uncommitted): plan (a) on a lone 3090; one functional `--place a` run on the 3090, then land. The
  README V4.1 3090 row (footnote 2) waits on it.
- visseat (V4c, GLM round running; base visref + visserve) and the visref follow-up (`tools/ref/vision/visref_ds41.rs`
  → a gpu-gates bin with a recipe). visref's mutant m2 (text bias on media) is invisible to the KLD band; only
  gate_ds41_media (ii) guards it; the paired design is proposed, not run.

**worker2 — eq and iq**
- eqA1 (tree, uncommitted, three writers): the AVX2 Q3_K hmask inversion, the scalar Q4_K qs offset, the q8_1 clamp, a
  cardrule_ties gate site; `crates/qdot/tests/qdot.rs` may still be broken. eqC (tree, uncommitted): owning gates green,
  gate-ptx-spill red on exactly 10 new entries; left the report, a rebase, the pin and the A/B; it touches
  gpu-deepseek41 `chain/ffn` and rebases onto visinj. E1 never ran (eqA1's card-rule arm in bench_v41_host plus a
  host-rate lease). Plan: the lead specs `multiseq2/eqdesign/report.md`.
- iqgemm (gemm_iq3xxs, iq4xs, iq4nl; 6 ptx-shapes rows), iqsel (check-unsafe red), q6khead (two edits outside its
  whitelist; `tools/unsafe-ratchet.txt` 1530 → 1552 against iqgemm's 1535): review, reconcile the ratchet, gate, land.
  Then iqwire and iqoracle, which let the Q3 file's IQ stacks run on the card.
- The penalty window: llama-server feeds the prompt ids into the sampler (`tools/server/server-context.cpp:420-424`);
  we feed only the generated ids. Change `Gen::answer` (via `choose`) and `Gen::advance_sampled`'s history together;
  `hw_drafted_sampled_ids_are_the_plain_ids` (`crates/serve/tests/sampdraft.rs`) guards the pair.

**Unowned, small**
- `content: "\n\n"` before a tool call (Qwen3.8, OpenAI tools): from the shared ThinkSplit and emit.
- sched floor: `crates/serve/src/sched.rs:345-375` best_slot lets a 1-id shared prefix beat an empty slot; llama-server
  uses a 0.1 similarity floor. ~10 lines plus a gate.
- Blackwell audit: log the JIT error (`cuModuleLoadData`); `cuStreamBatchMemOp` lacks an attribute check.
- clefvis design (the lead specs `release/clefvis/design.md`): llama.cpp mtmd preprocessing (black pad, 8–4096 tokens)
  chosen over the release's stretch rule; open.
- the test-host runner script: the job's ssh is not retried on a kex reset with no start line (the lead specs its line 36).
- line2's carry-forward items (the lead specs `multiseq2/carry-forward.md`, `[open]` rows) stay there until a round
  takes them.

### The 0.2.2 cut (10-06, line1 — re-cut at 11:50 by the user: "too big; cut it, and finish 0.2.2 faster")

**Freeze 14:00 KST, release right after.** 0.2.2 holds what has landed and the following:
- glmbpdef: on main directly if glmresdiag is not green by 13:15;
- anthropic;
- qualmig;
- glmresdiag, only if green by 13:45;
- slotpoison, only if R1–R4 match by 13:30;
- num3090run (tools; not gating).

**Moved to 0.2.3, still running:**
- q38tslots and q38tseat: bp is slower than one A6000, so they ship with the bp step-penalty fix;
- vision, after visref's verdict;
- Clef vision (`clefvis`): Clef-Flash is multimodal (Qwen3.5-9B backbone; bartowski ships
  `mmproj-Cloudflare_clef-flash-{bf16,f16}.gguf`), and llama.cpp's `/v1/systemone` takes its images through mtmd
  (a4cb4c61 `server-decision.cpp:199-242`, data URLs, at most 8). We refuse them by name
  (`crates/decision/src/request.rs:144`). Needs the Qwen3.5 vision tower on `gpu-vision`'s kernels, the mmproj reader,
  and visinj's injection lifted to a common owner for Body35. Design done (clefvis, 2026-10-06, kept outside the
  repo): tower `qwen3vl_merger` (27 × 1152, heads of 72, learned 48×48 positions, 2×2 merge to 4096, no DeepStack);
  `vis_gemm_bf16` as it is plus five new `vis_` entries (V4.1 md5 unmoved); M-RoPE injection through a per-call rope
  table with no new kernel. Rounds R0 oracle sets (mainline llama.cpp) · R1 preprocess (Mac) · R2 tower (L) · R3
  injection after visinj · R4 decide seat (`--mmproj`, `--image-min/max-tokens`; the refusal's "backbone reads text
  only" wording goes) · R5 one sitting. Preprocessing follows llama.cpp's mtmd (black pad, 8–4096 tokens), which can be
  proven byte for byte; the release's stretch rule is the open alternative;
- residency invariance (E1, eqC, eqA*);
- parity1;
- structured output.

**0.2.3 is Qwen-centred** (user, 2026-10-06, after a public tester with RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell 96 GB cards announced a
Qwen3.8 test against Strata). Owners:
- line1:
  - qwenxml: the Qwen3-Coder `<function=…><parameter=…>` tool-call parser for Qwen3.6/3.8, `ToolFormat::QwenXml`;
    0.2.2 answers their `tools` requests with a named 501;
  - sampdraft: design for MTP drafts on sampled requests. Only greedy requests draft today (`engine.rs:156-163`), and
    an absent `temperature` is 0.8;
  - q38tslots, q38tseat;
  - the IQ card rounds (iqsel, iqgemm, q6khead) for `UD-Q3_K_XL`.
- line2: q38big — the Qwen3.8 plan on 1/2/4 × 96 GB cards (host need, auto ctx, an empty tier on a file that fits),
  with the README's host-RAM rows by card size.
- line3: placeunset — one rule for an unset `--place`, Qwen3.8's bp default included.
- Vision (V3b/V4c), eqA1, eqC, E1: 0.2.4. visserve rides along if it is green after qwenxml.
- After qwenxml: a gate that every shipped seat's template maps to a parsed `ToolFormat`. 0.2.2 shipped two seats
  whose markup had no parser, and nothing pinned it.
- Docker: `container.yml` runs on the tag push before `publish.sh` uploads the assets. Its first attempt failed on
  v0.2.2 with a 404, and the rerun succeeded. Trigger it on the release's publish, or wait on the assets.

**Blackwell readiness** (bwready, an agy audit, 2026-10-06; lead-checked):
- The sm_86 PTX (`.version 8.7`) JITs on sm_120 with driver R570+, which every Blackwell card needs anyway.
- No instruction the kernels use is missing on sm_120.
- The largest dynamic shared request, 100,352 B (`flash_gqa_prefill.rs:2376`), is under the 99 KiB per-block opt-in
  on both 8.6 and 12.x.
- The JIT output fits the 1 GiB default compute cache.
- An unknown card is sized from the driver's census (`devices.rs:145-166`).
- Open:
  - a failed JIT reports only the driver's code: `cuda-core` calls `cuModuleLoadData` with no
    `CU_JIT_ERROR_LOG_BUFFER`. Size M, in the fork; an upstream candidate;
  - `cuStreamBatchMemOp_v2` (`graph.rs:611`) runs without checking `CAN_USE_STREAM_WAIT_VALUE_NOR`, so a card or
    driver without it fails on a driver code rather than a named error. Size S;
  - WSL2 limits pinned host memory. A large host tier there is unmeasured beyond sih022's 3060.
  - Prebuilt cubins (the user asked, 2026-10-07; after 0.2.6): ship sm_89 and sm_120 cubins beside the sm_86 PTX,
    and have the loader pick by the card's compute capability with the PTX as the fallback. Speed gain 0 by the model:
    the driver JIT and offline ptxas already allocate the same registers on all 72 entries (gates3a). What it removes
    is the first start's JIT (10–25 s measured on the A6000; unmeasured on a 5090), the JIT stretching the upload
    (ledger #37), and the risk of a JIT failure. Work: a multi-arch `cargo oxide` bundle, `load_bundle` choosing by
    CC (today it prefers any cubin), the ptx-scan readers that refuse a bundle where a cubin hides the PTX, and the
    release checks and asset name (`cuda-sm86`, pinned by install.sh and the Homebrew formula). An sm_120 cubin
    needs one run on a Blackwell card before it ships; we have none. Size M.
- The audit's "grid 1 on 188 SMs" for norms and the router is a latency term the step already pays on 84 SMs: 0 by
  the model, no round.

**What makes it fast:**
- no new A/B (glmbpdef's effect is glmbp-ab; qualmig is host-only with ptx equal to base);
- the README re-sit is not gating;
- a warm-up `release-build` at 11:55 so the freeze build is incremental;
- the release notes drafted before the freeze;
- no new release clips (0.2.1's stand).

The table below is the morning plan, kept for the items that moved.


Verification is light by the user's rule ("the big verification ran in 0.2.1; verify the changed parts only"). Each
piece lands on its owning gates plus the static checks, with ptx-scan wherever a kernel could move. There is no
full union batch. A same-lease A/B runs only for a piece that moves a dispatch path.

**Landed (main):**
- `4bf06411`, `61c05232`, `23ff9777` q3ilv (line2): Qwen3.6's busy slots in one pass; gate-gpu-qwen35moe-e2e and
  gate-gpu-qwen3-serve green.
- `6cc3e868` iqhost (line1): IQ4_NL / IQ4_XS host dots, 0 ULP against ik on real rows; gate-qdot and
  gate-gpu-qwen4exp-e2e green. Its qdot-rate lease (`docs/cards/iqhost-rate.card`) is still to sit.
- `01d8b285` coldslots (line2), `dbc7951a`: the depth runners' residency column counts the slots passes.
- `c194026b`, `52b163c4`: README numbers on one RTX 3090 and on A6000 + 3090 (rig-log 10-06#num3090); CONTRIBUTING
  welcomes AI-assisted pull requests and pull requests for hardware we do not have.

**In flight:**

| Item | Owner | What it does | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| q38tslots | line1, GLM round | Qwen3.8 several slots in one pass on `--place bp` (the tier sized to the step port's 8 columns, `body38.rs:3957-3962` refusal gone) | running; spec `specs/release/q38tier/specs/q38tslots.md` |
| q38tseat | line1, after q38tslots + num3090run + qualmig | the qwen38 seat runs one pass on every placement (`pass_of_slots` loses `!tiered`) | spec ready |
| num3090run | line1, opus round | the runners time `--place a` on a lone 3090 (the server's own plan and residency); Qwen3.8's load line names its cards through `generate::card_words` | running |
| qualmig | line2 | every seat's rounds through `rounds::step_round` / `pass_round`; host only, ptx equal to base | gates on the round ledger |
| slotpoison | line2 | a host tier that refused after a launch releases the card's waits (no server hang) | in only if R1–R4 match today |
| glmresdiag | line3 | GLM's residency diagnosis flags and one residency clause owner | four-key rerun; GLM static may miss 0.2.2 |
| glmbpdef | line3 | the GLM seat's unset `--place` is `bp` when a second card is visible and the plan has room (glmbp-ab +13.0 % ± 2.8 decode, +11.1 % ± 0.5 pp512) | after glmresdiag |
| vision V3b/V4b/V3c/V4c | line3 owns the landing | V4.1 images: visinj (engine injection), visserve (API), visref (the smalinin-fork oracle, KLD and top-1 against a text-only control band, real-image answers to a vision judge), visseat (the seat) | visserve rebased; visinj in mutants; visref on the box; visseat to spec |
| eqA1, eqC, E1 | line2 | residency invariance as the default (below) | eqA1 and eqC running |
| anthropic | line1, opus round | `/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens` as llama-server serves them | running |
| parity1 | line1, after anthropic lands | `--api-key`, `/v1/responses` (+ `/input_tokens`), `/v1/completions`, `/chat/completions/input_tokens` | to spec |

**Re-sit for the README** (one hold, after num3090run): the following rows.
- V4.1 on the 3090 at `--place a` (residency on).
- Qwen3.8 bp, one stream and two.
- Qwen3.6 two-request on the 3090. The 10-06 window read 254.3 / 254.7 / 254.8 but carried [cpu-busy] [other-busy]
  [cold], so it is void.
- `q38tbp-gap` (where the bp step's +5.92 ms sits).

**Decisions of the day:**
- **Qwen3.8 on two cards** (design `specs/release/q38tier/report`):
  - The prompt is already batched over the tier (`d6ca8ed2`). Only the several-slots pass was missing.
  - bp is slower than the A6000 alone. One stream measures 44.95 tok/s (runner-rejected rows) against 61.22. Two
    streams after q38tslots are predicted at 63..78 against 82.70 [derived].
  - So Qwen3.8 keeps `--place a` as its recommendation and gets no bp default.
  - The lever is the bp step penalty, 123 µs a layer, up to +36 % [derived].
- **Residency invariance** (eqdesign, `specs/multiseq2/eqdesign/report.md`):
  - The user first chose an opt-in `--strict`, then withdrew it ("decided too early; handle it as fully as we can").
  - The goal is invariance on by default: the host takes the card's q8_1 rule (A), and one slot-order combine runs
    across the tiers (C).
  - Predicted cost [derived]: V4.1 decode −0.1..−0.4 %, prose prefill 0..−1.8 %, lcg prefill 0..−10 %. GLM decode
    ≤ −0.8 %. Qwen3.8 0..−1 %.
  - E1, the host bench of the card rule, measures the one open term before eqA2 wires V4.1.
  - If E1 shows a real cost, bring the number to the user before any opt-in mode.
  - 0.2.2 takes E1 and C if they are green today. eqA2 (V4.1), GLM and Qwen3.8 follow.

### llama-server parity (10-06, line1 — the user: "what llama-server does that we do not"; read from llama.cpp `9e47962ef` `tools/server/server.cpp:250-372` against our `crates/serve/src/api.rs:769`, `:849-865`)

| Gap | What uses it | Size | Release |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/v1/messages`, `/v1/messages/count_tokens` (Anthropic) | Claude Code, the Anthropic SDK (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) | S–M, serve only | 0.2.2 (round anthropic) |
| `--api-key` | any server reachable past localhost; today there is no key check at all | S | 0.2.2 (parity1) |
| `/v1/responses`, `/responses`, `/v1/responses/input_tokens` (OpenAI Responses API) | Codex CLI, new OpenAI SDK clients | S–M, a conversion layer like anthropic's | 0.2.2 (parity1) |
| `/v1/completions` (OpenAI text completion) | OpenAI-compatible text clients; we serve `/completion` and `/completions` only | XS | 0.2.2 (parity1) |
| `/chat/completions/input_tokens`, `/v1/chat/completions/input_tokens` | token counting before a request | XS, shares count_tokens' core | 0.2.2 (parity1) |
| `response_format` (JSON mode), `json_schema`, `grammar` | structured output for agents and apps; refused by name today (`api.rs:849-865`) | M–L: a grammar-constrained sampler on every seat | 0.2.3, first |
| `logprobs`, `top_logprobs`, `n_probs` | eval harnesses, some clients; refused today | S–M: per-token top-k of the head's logits | 0.2.3 |
| `n > 1` | several answers a request | M: the slots | later |
| `/infill` (FIM) | editor completion plugins; needs a model with FIM tokens | S | later, with a FIM-capable model |
| `/v1/chat/completions/control`, `GET/DELETE /v1/stream`, `/v1/streams/lookup` | stop a running generation, reattach a dropped stream | M | later |
| embeddings, rerank, audio transcription, LoRA adapters, `/models/load`·`/unload` (router mode), web UI, `/tools`, `/cors-proxy` | — | — | out of scope: no such model or mode in bloomery |

Rule for each row: llama-server's handler and its `tools/server/tests/unit/test_*.py` cases are the oracle. The cases
port to `crates/serve/tests/`, one test per contract. An unsupported field stays refused by name until its row
lands.

### The 0.2.1 cut (10-05 night → 10-06, line1 — the hold below is lifted: 0.2.1 waited for multistream on every family)

**In the train** (on main `6bcb1168`, version `c7eb555e`): every generative seat's slots are resident sequences
(V4.1 `a03e3612`·`5b7973ba`, GLM `22a80509`·`354eb29a`, Qwen3.6 `cb2f4687`); one pass of the busy rows on a whole-card
Qwen3-30B, V4.1 (two-row slot pass `008cb859`), GLM and Qwen3.8 (drafted windows O3c `285ad4d0`, glmseatdraft; plain
rows q38pass `c6008b16`); the GLM skip path pinned (glmskip `02d0a0b7`); the residency diagnosis owner (reslift
`ce552605`); GEN_SLOTS arms for V4.1, GLM, Qwen3.8 (sb41land, glmslots); the prompt-quantum mechanism with no seat
opted in (promptlv `d73f4479`); the vision encoder's scratch once a load (v3s `9bd5992a`). No seat takes turns any
more: `serve::SwapEngine` is built only by the serve crate's tests, and `bind::Parallel::of_turn_slots` only by
`bind.rs`'s own tests (census021, at `c7eb555e`).

**Morning branches (not in 0.2.1):**
- **slotpoison** (line2): green on glm5next-e2e, ds41-step, qwen3moe-e2e, qwen35moe-e2e; `gate-gpu-qwen4exp-e2e` red
  on its H5 window — Body38 refuses `select(1)` after a failed two-slot pass while a verify waits for its commit (an
  engine-owner question: should the poison path clear that wait). Also open: a poisoned tier that refuses after a
  launch without `release_all` hangs the card wait (reached only after a named device fault on a host-tier load).
- **q36rows** (line2): Qwen3.6 one pass (`Body35` gains `SlotRows`); red at 10-06 03:49; tree kept.
- **promptseat41** (line1): V4.1 opts into the prompt quantum at the window ring's rows (`Body::ring_rows`, 128);
  Mac green and the round-ledger trio green on base `14912d3d`; conflicts with stgseat2 in
  `serve_seats/ds41.rs`, `ds41_serve_levers.rs` and the ds41 schema (both add `BLOOMERY_STEP_STATS` wiring); box proof
  (q1 residency off, q2 default, the mutant) not run. Tree `bloomery-promptseat41`.
- **glmbpdef** `830e69f9` (line3): GLM `--place bp` when the tier holds ≥ E* = 526 experts — lands only if the glmbp
  sitting's lower bounds clear 0.
- **glmresdiag** (line3): GLM's wiring of the shared residency diagnosis, and the A6000 margin run at positions 20/12.
- **visinj / visserve** (line1): V4.1 vision V3a/V3b and V4b; GLM continuations from their `*-spec-c.md`.
- **detinv** (line1): placement-invariant expert arithmetic, the card mirroring the host qdot (q8_K x, q8_2_x4 h, the
  host sum order) and one int64 fixed-point combine owner — +0.2 % centre, +1.2 % worst [derived], size L.
- **qualmig** (line2): glm/ds41 `step_slots` and the GLM/qwen38 `pass_slots` onto the rounds helpers.
- GLM's sampled rows in one pass (a zero-proposal window; four owners) — design after 0.2.1.

**census021's outside items** (`c7eb555e` lines): the elastic-park code is dead (`crates/gpu-gates/src/bind.rs:424-551`,
`:711-714`, `:1047-1053`, its tests `:2215-2288`; delete or re-point, M); the turns half of the serve worker
(`crates/serve/src/swap.rs:66`, `crates/serve/src/worker.rs:721-1169`) is reachable only from `tests/slots`
(keep-or-cut, L); `bind.rs:759-764` still lists landed seats as future (S); the qwen3 seat's `load`/`listening`
records carry no `total` (`serve_seats/qwen3.rs:652-663`, S); qwen38's `BreakEven::of` stands `PLAIN_TPS` in for the
prompt rate under `--place bp` (`serve_seats/qwen38.rs:327-338`, S/M); the decide seat answers `--parallel` with a
generic `unknown argument` (`serve_seats/decide.rs:182`, S).

### 0.2.1 준비 회차 (10-03~04, 리드 — superseded by the cut above)

**착지 전부(main `da00c5d4`까지, 각 트랙 리드 검증 후 ff-머지·푸시·track 청소):**

- **좌석 ctx 전면**: qwen3 통짜(`7fab4e21`)·placed 폴백(placectx `ded96616`, 바닥 expert 분할 유지 최대)·qwen38 fit 마진(4096→40,704)·glm(2048→16,384, 공유 소유자 serve_seats::ctx, glmctx `5bb0b045`).
- **게이트 빚 5절 닫힘**(gatedebt `75d70794`); **cleanup 7항목**(`9110b7d4`; stub 실패는 머신 전체 pgmajfault 환경 노이즈 — ds41/qwen3moe 설계로 수선).
- **탄성 `--parallel` + qwen38 MTP 재결합**(parwave `88b0c888`; 기본 슬롯 min(4, 1+park/state 예산), 플래그는 상한; qwen38 좌석 `--parallel`+`--park-ram`, 뮤턴트 4종 red).
- **kvq8 3조각 완결**(형식 `00034f5c` → 읽기 `a5d233be` → 배선 `28ff8c03`): `KvPlanes`가 적재의 단일 캐시 형식 선택, 레버 `BLOOMERY_QWEN3_KV` + 좌석 `--cache-type-k q8_0|f16`(`--cache-type-v`는 이름으로 거부), 예산 17/16 B/value가 whole/placed ctx 탐색 전 경로에 — **자동 ctx f16 49,152 → q8_0 92,160 = 1.875× (기능 실측 3090)**, 계획 kv_bytes 132,120,576 → 70,189,056 B(정확히 17/32). 소유 게이트 3종 리드 재실행 초록; A6000에선 두 형식이 261,120에 닿아 성장 관계가 공소 → 17/32 계획항 핀(qwen3moe-e2e)과 resident-delta 관계(qwen3-serve)가 뮤턴트를 죽는다. 기본 전환은 별도 결정(레버 opt-in 유지).
- **`reasoning_budget` 요청 필드**(thinkcap `2ff186a1`, kvq8-3 대기 중 리드 설계): llama-server `--reasoning-budget`를 요청 단위로 — 프롬프트가 `<think>`로 스팬을 열 때만 살고, 스팬 열린 채 생성 id N개(0 포함; -1/생략 무제한)면 서버가 `</think>` id를 강제 먹여 닫는다. 엔진 트레잇 불변(`next(last)`의 서버 소유 피드) 덕에 트레잇 변경 없이 `Gen::answer` 대체점 + advance 게이트(`left < rows`면 단보)로 구현; close가 실제 컨텍스트에 들가는 것을 ds41 좌석 절 6개가 증명(자유 실행 8 id → 9번째 강제 close → continuation이 close를 프롬프트 id로 먹인 새 실행과 같음, 후속 턴 프리픽스 유지). reasoning_effort·chat_template_kwargs에 이어 빠진 마지막 reasoning 노브.
- **jitovl**(KEEP, `d4d5bc2d`): 번들 JIT를 적재 업로드 옆 스레드로. 측정 손익 0 — **드라이버가 same-context 업로드와 cuModuleLoadData 컴파일을 직렬화한다**는 것이 이 라운드의 실제 발견(ledger #37, cubin 페이로드가 max(JIT, load)의 길). 게이트 8 초록, ptx-scan 표 동일(551+406행, 번들 총바이트만 +151B 메타데이터 성장 — 엔트리 불변), unsafe 핀 1579/160 합산 해결.
- **smallfix**(`421050a1`): bp 손익의 근거가 qwen38 two-card 임대 A/B(`docs/cards/q38tier-ab.card`)를 기다린다고 코드 옆에 명명, /slots 낡은 줄 삭제.
- **출시 기계**(0.2.0 저녁~): `tools/release/publish.sh`(태그·양쪽 크레이트 버전 점검, 박스 재검증, build.sh 이름 그대로 업로드, tap 범프) · install.sh sha 수정 · container.yml actions 버전업. 채널 검증 상태는 C절 참조.

**QA 클립 (toktape 0.7.1, 10-04, A6000, functional — 임대 밖 숫자):** 4/6 녹화·허브 게시 — qwen3 f16 `slot_ctx 49152` agg 42.7 tok/s [tape](https://tape.midagedev.com/r/aay2zmi5njm5pgx2dk32) · **qwen3 q8_0 `slot_ctx 92160`** agg 38.4 [tape](https://tape.midagedev.com/r/wsmcsgk2yn4mszpnysvx) (자동-ctx 1.875×가 테이프 안에서 직접 보임; ~~스트림당 −9%는 스칼라 q8 읽기 경로~~ 정정 10-05: 디코드는 mma 패스이고 두 테이프는 ctx가 다르다(slot_ctx 92160 대 f16 팔). −9 %는 같은 ctx의 비교가 아니므로 형식 탓이 아니다. f16 기본 경로의 소스는 kvq8 전후로 바이트까지 같다(line3 감사 M15). 정식 A/B는 별도 결정) · glm place a `slot_ctx 16384` 17.9(추론 토큰 = 전체) [tape](https://tape.midagedev.com/r/43p2wqvh7f4g4zsdnqsk) · qwen38 2스트림 `slot_ctx 35840`(A6000 마진 규칙) 35.6 [tape](https://tape.midagedev.com/r/fhrkqev692cijuhen4b4). 미녹화 둘: **ds41** — V4.1 9샤드 + 호스트 티어 SwapMachine 적재가 toktape 15분 대기창을 넘김(다음은 `--wait 30m` 또는 예열 서버; 서버 자체는 건강했다) · **decide** — `/v1/chat/completions`가 없는 `/v1/systemone` 와이어, `toktape decide` 동사로 찍어야 한다. 클립 스크립트가 이 회차에서 배운 것: 서버 스폰은 서브셸 `( nohup … & )`로 떼어야 ssh가 닫힌다, 정지는 `pkill -x bloomery-serve`(패턴 `-f`는 자기 명령줄을 죽인다), 라벨은 `--tag`(`--label` 없음), decide 좌석엔 `--parallel` 플래그 자체가 없다, ds41 파일은 V4.1-Flash(Q3_K_M 9샤드)이지 V4-Flash가 아니다(258 피처 이름 거부가 올바르게 동작).

**보류 시점 (10-04, 사용자 결정 — 재개 조건):** 컷 직전까지 와 있었다(양쪽 크레이트 범프 → `just release-build` → `publish.sh` → 태그만 남음). 재개 전에 볼 것: 아래 qwen4exp-mtp 빨강(0.2.1의 qwen38 MTP 경로), 그리고 릴리스 노트가 인용할 A/B 카드 값(q38tier-ab 미시행).

**이 회차가 남긴 열린 것:**
- **`gate-gpu-qwen4exp-mtp` base 빨강 (S)**: `Mtp38: rows 0..8 of the Pass arena as positions 55..63 for a walk from 56: the arena holds positions 56..64` — walk 시작의 경계 off-by-one 버그 후보. parwave가 착지 배치에서 이 게이트를 안 돌렸고(Seq38 꼬리 clamp 둘이 이 문자와 닿는다) a5d233be에서도 빨강. **0.2.1의 qwen38 MTP 기능이 닿는 경로라 출시 전 검토 권고.**
- **`props_engine_bytes_are_the_plans` 센서스 빨강(셋째 사례, B절)**: live free-bytes 배치 vs 게이트의 정적 plan_gate 숫자 ~300 MB 어긋남. `weekly-gpu-ds41-serve`의 `&&` 사슬을 끊어 draft·bp 팔을 못 돌게 한다.
- ~~**parwave의 serve측 슬롯 경합 (S, 미수선)**: 슬롯 ≥2에서 이전 요청의 해제보다 먼저 온 요청이 LRU로 안 쓴 슬롯을 가져가고 슬롯 주소 `erase`가 다른 슬롯의 남은 것을 지운다(ids는 무스위치 실행과 동일로 검증됨). 게이트들은 `--parallel 1`로 고정.~~ **Split (10-05, slotrace):** (a) the request-arrival choice is closed by fslot `9f103368` (`end_request` releases before `Done`, the tie rule prefers the engine's slot); (b) the erase is real but sits in `run_turns`' switch before a slot action (`worker.rs:655-663`), fixed on branch `slotrace` `06860ce4` (two `hw_` gates in `tests/slots/mod.rs`, red before) — in the 0.2.1 batch.
- **선결 게이트 빚 둘 → 닫힘**: `gate-ds41-place`(테스트 strip이 free_bytes/held_by도 지우게, `f9c366ea`) · `gate-ds41-load` check v(jitonce 유지 모듈의 4 MiB 첫 드롭을 PIN(2026-10-04) `2×PINNED_GRANULE`로) — jitovl 착지 배치가 둘 다 초록으로 재확인.
- **placectx 열린 끝**: 여유 큰 카드에선 m1형 뮤턴트의 답이 정답과 우연히 같다 — 적재된 서버 옆 교차 센서스 비교가 필요.

### 다음 릴리즈 백로그 (10-04 수집, 리드 — 0.2.0·설치 채널 뒤의 열린 것을 한 곳에; 중복 줄은 아래 각절이 주인)

**범위 결정(10-04, 사용자)**: **0.2.1 소형 먼저** — A(서빙 견고성·UX) + B(게이트 빚) + C(출시 채널 빚) + D(청소 트레인) + GLM 조기 레버 둘(P=0 기본 XS·staging 창 밖 멈춤, 각각 아래 조건 뒤)을 넣고, E의 나머지(prompt-call pick·glmnext 레버·callstream·qwen38 사다리·warm 재측정 시팅·새 모델 행)는 **0.3.0**으로 간다. 0.2.1의 숫자 표는 갱신하지 않고 릴리스 노트가 A/B 카드 값을 조건과 함께 인용한다(전면 warm 재측정은 0.3.0의 시팅).

**A. 서빙 견고성·UX (사용자가 바로 겪음)**
- ~~서버 견고성 셋~~ **이미 착지(10-04 확인)**: `MAX_CONNECTIONS` 64 + Permit 503(`api.rs`), logits 재사용 버퍼(`genloop.rs` `logits_out()`), 초과 프롬프트의 400 `exceed_context_size_error`(`api.rs:1486`) — 출시 트랙 절의 이 세 줄은 낡았다.
- ~~`--ctx` 기본을 모델 학습 컨텍스트에서~~ **qwen3·glm 좌석 착지(10-04, `7fab4e21`·glmctx)**: qwen3의 통짜 적재는 학습 컨텍스트를 카드 여유에 맞는 최대(1024 단위, 하한 4096)로 상한; glm 좌석은 항상 배치 적재라 계획이 감당하는 최대(하한 2048, qwen38의 마진 규칙이 카드 전문가 1 GiB 이상 안 잃게, `serve_seats::ctx` 공유 소유)를 타고, stderr에 `ctx rule=…` 한 줄. 남은 것: qwen38(4096 기본 유지가 의도), ds41은 32k 기본 의도대로 둠.
- 탄성 `--parallel`: park 예산이 감당하는 만큼 기본, 플래그는 상한 (S) — 같은 미룸.
- Qwen3.8 MTP 재결합 → qwen38 좌석 `--parallel` (S–M) — glmsave의 공유 park/unpark 위 `Seq38`(glmsave2 보고 §6).
- ~~서빙 작은 것들: `partial_path` 프로세스 단위 충돌(원자 카운터, S) · `http.rs` 퍼센트 디코딩(S).~~ **Already in the code (10-05 check):** `genloop.rs:817` `partial_path` (pid + a per-process count; test `partial_paths_are_distinct_per_save`), `http.rs:63` `percent_decode`. slotsnap 절 참조.
- 빈 캐시 첫 시작의 마지막 JIT가 직렬 (M): 번들 JIT ~7 s를 적재 업로드 옆 스레드로 → 첫 시작 ≈ max(JIT, load). line3 절 참조.
- memguard 잔여: 홀드된 카드 위 serve 응답 비교 한 줄 · auto-placed 실행의 `--prefill gemm` 거부가 적재 뒤에 온다(좌석 문서에 이미 적힘).
- **lane X의 센서스 타는 핀이 같은 레인 앞 팔의 잔류에 흔들린다 (S, 10-04 ctxauto 묶음에서 발견)**: qwen38-serve의 `ctx_line_prints_the_fit_and_the_margin`이 glm 서버 SIGKILL 직후의 낮은 여유 판독에서 1 GiB 마진 경계가 385 KB 밀려 빨강, 단독 재실행 초록. 게이트가 카드 여유에 타는 핀을 절대값으로 쥐는 곳마다 같은 모양 — lane X가 다음 팔을 띄우기 전 카드 여유가 안정될 때까지 기다리는 것(gpu-gate.sh 또는 gate-batch)이 일반 수선, 아니면 그 핀을 서버와 같은 lost() 걸음에서 유도. glmctx 회차(10-04) 같은 모양 재확인: 병렬 회차의 게이트가 카드를 쥐고 있는 동안 3회 빨강(게이트의 재유도가 좌석의 줄과 389 MiB 어긋남 — 서버의 `plan` 줄이 플러시되기 전에 죽어 `card_free` 읽기가 빠지면 게이트가 여유 없이 짜는 모양과 맞물림 [추정]), 조용한 박스에서 단독 초록. **같은 패밀리 셋째 사례 (10-04, thinkcap이 분리)**: `gate_ds41_serve`의 `props_engine_bytes_are_the_plans`가 base `d03e788f`에서도 빨강 — 서버의 live placement(free-bytes 적응, `card_experts=1128`·온카드 `ngram` 클래스)가 게이트의 정적 `plan_gate` 숫자와 ~300 MB 어긋난다(같은 회차 초반엔 초록이었으니 기계 상태가 도는 중). 이 빨강이 `weekly-gpu-ds41-serve`의 `&&` 사슬을 끊어 draft·bp 팔이 그 회차에 못 돌았다(그 팔에는 budget 절이 없다).

**B. 게이트 빚 (증명 구멍, 모두 절 주인이 있는 것의 이름만)**
- ~~MODELS/FIRST_START 상수 줄 절 · qwen3 스왑 ids-동일 절 · `plan_nextn` FrontOver FAIL-first · serve 게이트의 drafted CLI arm 컷 · q38sel 풀 합 순서 절~~ **착지(10-03, `gatedebt`)**: 넷은 이번 라운드가 절과 뮤턴트 빨강으로 닫았고(clef-serve·qwen3-serve·glm5next-residency·glm5next-serve), 풀 합 순서 절은 이미 `f6a62a52`(poolord)가 싣고 있었다(트리아지 줄이 낡았다; m01 빨강은 이번 라운드가 박스에서 다시 증명).

**C. 설치·출시 채널 (0.2.0 저녁 작업의 빚)**
- **publish 절차 스키 없음 (S)**: 이번 애셋 이름 사고(`release-upload.tar.gz`로 404)는 수동 업로드 탓 — `tools/release/publish.sh`가 박스에서 타르볼·sha를 받아 네 검사를 재확인하고 build.sh가 쓴 이름으로만 업로드하며, 릴리스 body의 Install 절을 버전·sha와 함께 갱신한다. 크레이트 버전(bloomery-serve·gpu-gates 둘) 올리는 것도 절차에 넣는다.
- **채널 검증 상태 (10-04, 사용자 결정: 테스트 호스트에서 GPU·brew 전수검증은 하지 않는다)**: 검증된 것 — formula의 URL·sha256 바이트 정합과 파싱(맥 `brew fetch --bottle-tag=x86_64_linux`), ghcr 이미지 pull·CPU `--version`(맥 linux/amd64), curl|sh 설치자 end-to-end(테스트 호스트 WSL, 0.2.0 당시 8/8 응답 동일). 미검증 — `--gpus all` GPU 패스스루(도커 데몬이 nvidia-container-toolkit을 요구했고 설치는 취소), `brew install` 완주(실리콘 x86_64 brew 머신 없음). GitHub Actions의 ubuntu-latest에서 formula 빌드만은 검증 가능(비-GPU, --version 테스트 블록) — 후보로 남긴다.
- brew formula 실설치 검증: 맥의 `brew fetch`는 URL·sha를 뒀고 formula 파싱은 됐으나 전체 `brew install` 완주는 이 맥의 QEMU 컨테이너에서 불가했다(SSSE3 게이트·TTY 프로브·popen 교착). brew가 있는 x86_64 리눅스 한 대에서 한 번(S, 테스트 호스트 WSL에 brew를 설치할지는 사용자 결정).
- 도커 GPU 경로 실기 검증: ghcr 이미지의 `--version`까지는 검증; NVIDIA Container Toolkit 호스트에서의 서빙 실행은 한 번도 안 돌았다(맥에 NVIDIA 런타임 없음, 박스에 docker 없음).
- container.yml의 actions가 Node 20 deprecation 경고(버전 올리기, XS).
- 다음 릴리스부터 workflow가 자동으로 이미징한다(v* 태그) — 태그 푸시 = 이미지 게시임을 release 절차 문서에 한 줄.

**D. 청소 묶음 (XS~S 모음, 익스프레스 트레인 한 대)**

### 0.2.0의 날이 남긴 것 (10-03 밤, 리드 — decideseat·q3off·slotswap·glmsave·P3·seatpick·P4·memguard·glmnext 착지, 8d62f74a·68f72d68)

- **Qwen3.8 MTP 재결합 (S–M)**: glmsave가 `mtp.rs`의 park/unpark를 공유 코드로 넣었다. `Seq38`에 스토어
  행과 held, 아레나의 Wrote/Held 위치 기록, 좌석의 `drafted.park()/unpark()` (glmsave2 보고 §6). 그 뒤
  qwen38 좌석도 `--parallel`.
- **`--ctx` 기본을 모델에서 (S, 0.2.1 후보)**: 학습 컨텍스트에서 읽고 메모리가 못 받으면 이름 붙인 거부.
- **탄력 `--parallel` (S, 0.2.1 후보)**: park 예산이 감당하는 만큼 기본, 플래그는 상한 (오늘은 llama 호환
  고정값 2).
- **flow 계획 핀은 여유를 탄다 (알림)**: `routes.py`의 계획 핀(2651)은 records-refresh 당시 카드 여유에
  의존한다 — 홀드된 카드에서 재생성하면 옮겨 적을 것 (PIN 주석 참조).
- **memguard 뒤에 남은 것**: 홀드된 카드 위 serve 응답 비교 한 줄(에이전트 보고 §7); auto-placed 실행의
  `--prefill gemm` 거부가 적재 뒤에 온다(좌석 문서에 이미 적힘).

### What glmquality left (line3, 10-05 — a read-only review of `crates/gpu-glm5next/src`, 16 files)

No silent-failure violation found. F6 (three copies of the embedding-row read) and F11 (host `as u32` narrowing) are
round glmq1; F10 was dropped (`GemmFront::act` and `project` differ on purpose: `project` refuses the SwiGLU rows).

- **F2 — `GlmHost` is a copy of the common `HostRun` (M). First round after 0.2.1.** `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/host.rs:23`
  repeats `crates/gpu/src/host/run.rs:30` field for field, with the same `experts_into`/`experts_union_into` bodies and
  the same refusal strings, and no measured-gain note. `HostRun::prepare_union` is also the stricter of the two (it
  refuses `cols` past what was made). Fix: `GlmHost` becomes `HostRun` built with GLM's layer lookup closure. Proof:
  move class (ptx-scan `generate_glm5next` equal); a gate clause matching a `GlmHost::` refusal text re-pins with its
  dated attribution. `Ds41Host` (`crates/gpu-deepseek41/src/chain/ffn.rs:1736`) is a third variant of the same
  adapter and follows in the same round.
- **F1 — the Steps feed has two marks walks with different failure rules (S, needs a decision).**
  `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/body.rs:1954` (`prompt`, reached by `feed` Steps and `prompt_with(Steps, None)`) steps a
  segment between marks at a time and passes a failed step's error up with the model standing mid-prompt.
  `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/prefill.rs:882` (`steps_with`, reached only with a sink) steps one id at a time and takes
  the model back to the call's start (`take_back`). Whether a failure rolls back depends on whether a sink was passed.
  Pick one rule, then one loop. Opt-in path only (`BLOOMERY_PREFILL=steps`, refused under a residency).
- **F3 — `refuse_steps_under_residency` twice (S).** `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/body.rs:2447` and
  `crates/gpu-deepseek41/src/body.rs:193`, the same rule and the same user-facing text; only ds41's has a unit test.
  One function beside `Residency` in `crates/gpu/src/host/swap.rs`, with the test moved beside it.
- **F4 — `take_back` twice (S/M).** `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/prefill.rs:1267` and
  `crates/gpu-deepseek41/src/body/prefill.rs:637`: the same branch (a fault passes, else `keep_point` and `rollback`),
  the rollback-failed message word for word. One helper beside `GpuModel::rollback`.
- **F5 — `PrefillMode` twice (S).** `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/prefill.rs:161` and
  `crates/gpu-deepseek41/src/body/prefill.rs:166`, the enum, `from_name` and `name` byte for byte; it is the type of
  the one lever row `BLOOMERY_PREFILL`. It moves into `bloomery_levers`, re-exported by each body.
- **F7 — routed stack names formatted on the step path (S/M, A/B).** `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/ffn.rs:296`
  (`stack_names`: three fresh `String`s and three map lookups a card layer a row a step, from `card_slots`, `card_rows`
  and the tier) breaks the crate's own contract (`crates/gpu-glm5next/src/tensors.rs:1`: names made once at load, the
  step "formats none"). The three names go into `FfnNames::Moe` at load. Dispatch-path touch: a same-lease A/B with an
  A/A arm.
- **F8 — a third FNV-1a, this one in a library crate (S).** `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/prefill.rs:1400` beside
  `crates/gpu-gates/src/lib.rs:446` (`Fnv1a64`, public) and `crates/gpu/src/host/swap.rs:2963` (`counts_digest`).
  `Fnv1a64` moves into `bloomery_gpu` (gpu-gates re-exports it) with a `u16`-words method for the f16 planes.
- **F9 — the Q4_K/Q5_K entry dispatch written four times (M).** `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/ffn.rs:536` (`card_slots`),
  `ffn.rs:719` (`card_rows`), `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/tier.rs:297` (`enqueue_block`) and `tier.rs:376`
  (`enqueue_layer`); a new routable type is four edits. One gate·up/down helper pair in `ffn.rs` for both pairs.
  Proof: ptx-scan equal.
- **Seal `SlotRange` (S/M, after 0.2.1; qual1-M3).** `crates/gpu/src/model/slots.rs:178` has public fields, while
  its one constructor, `GpuModel::slot_ranges` (`slots.rs:507-551`), lays the ranges from row 0 with no gap or overlap.
  So the bodies' own tiling checks guard a state no caller can reach today: `crates/gpu/src/arch/qwen3moe/body38.rs:4254`
  (`slot_rows`) and `crates/gpu/src/arch/qwen3moe/slot_pass.rs:241` (`check`). GLM's `Body::refuse_slots`
  (`crates/gpu-glm5next/src/pair.rs:579`) has none. Make the range set constructible only by `slot_ranges` (private
  fields, or a `SlotRanges` newtype), then delete the two body checks. Proof: move class; the slot gates of the three
  bodies stay green.
- **From the GLM two-card cards (glm2card, `docs/cards/glmbp-ab.card`, `glmbp-pp.card`) — four tier items:**
  - *The tier's prompt block on the tile path (M).* `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/tier.rs:281` still serves a prompt
    block by 8-token chunks of `_sel` launches, which re-read each slot's expert: ~8.6 GB of 3090 reads a
    layer-batch [derived] where glmnext's tile path would read ~0.6 GB, and fewer enqueue calls on the serve thread.
  - *Packed tier rows for GLM (S).* `crates/gpu/src/host/tier.rs:831` defaults `block_rows` to `BlockRows::Staged`,
    which GLM keeps: every slot's row crosses PCIe, 67.1 MB a layer-batch, against ~9.25 MB `Packed` [derived].
  - *The stage card's reserve taken off the tier too (S).* `crates/placement/src/placement.rs:1792-1801` hands the
    tier's `Fill` the same `reserve` (NextN bytes, arena, prompt front, card tiles, group units, ~628 MB) though the
    tier uses none of it: ~45 tier experts fewer (1,546 against 1,501 [derived]), ~+0.3 % decode under bp.
  - *`BLOOMERY_STEP_STATS` beside the draft (M).* `crates/gpu-gates/src/bin/generate_glm5next.rs:403` refuses the
    probes beside the NextN draft, so a drafted arm cannot print its host slots or tier hits; the two-card card had
    to read the tier through `host_experts` differences.
- **Outside the crate (from the same review).** `crates/gpu/src/weights.rs:549`: `Weights::get` is a
  `BTreeMap<String, _>` lookup, so every body pays name lookups on the step unless it resolves at load; a load-time
  handle is a design question (M). The Q8_0 block geometry has four private owners
  (`crates/gpu-deepseek41/src/chain/glue.rs:82`, `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/body.rs:658` writes `n_embd / 32 * 34`,
  and two in `crates/gpu/src`) while `gguf::quant` exposes `blck_size`/`type_size` (S). The attention scale
  `1 / sqrt(head_k)` is computed at each call site (`crates/gpu-glm5next/src/prefill.rs:2362`,
  `crates/gpu-glm5next/src/mla.rs:338`); one `Dims` field set at load (XS).

### What jitonce, relfollow, sysone and decideseat phase 1 left (line3, 10-03 — 412367f3, 2e0189f2)

- **Raw bundle loads outside `shared_module!` (S).** `crates/gpu-vision/src/{attn,mlp,norm,rope2d,aligner,gemm_bf16}.rs`
  and `encoder.rs:201` (7 loads per vision encoder), and `gate_kquant.rs`/`gate_swap.rs` in gpu-gates. One line each.
- **The empty-cache start's last JIT runs serially (M).** One bundle JIT (about 7 s [derived]) before the weights
  upload. Running it on a thread beside the upload brings an empty-cache start to about max(JIT, load) [derived].
  Upstream shape: a per-context module cache or a generated `load_shared` in cuda-host (nvlabs ledger #37).
- **Body35's routed types pass coverage and are refused at load (S).** `crates/placement/src/placement.rs:367`
  `CardFormat::of_routed` lets Q3_K/Q6_K routed gate·up through; Body35 reads Q4_K only.
- **Qwen3moeBody's coverage pins are looser than `kq_site` (S).** `crates/model/src/arch/coverage.rs` vs
  `gpu/src/arch/qwen3moe/body.rs:312-318` (q/k/o read Q4_K only).
- **Qwen3.8's bp break-even uses the decode rate (S, after q3off).** `serve_seats/qwen38.rs:284` `Kind38::Bp => PLAIN_TPS`;
  bp's prompt now runs ubatches, so its prompt rate needs one measurement.
- **Comments that still find the A6000 by name (S).** `tools/ref/depth-glm5next.sh:180,398`,
  `depth-qwen3moe.sh:956`, `nsys-ds41.sh:41`, `timing-card.sh:39`.
- **`depth-glm5next-stub.sh` fails a different case each run, on the base too (M).** Cause not known.
- **`tools/recipes.py:5183` pins the count of `bind::` tests at 2 (S).** Count them from the tree.
- **`body35.rs:2` calls Clef's backbone Qwen3.5-27B (XS, after q3off).** Clef-Flash is Qwen3.5-9B (4096 wide).
- **The decide seat's listening line is stdout text, not a record Kind (S, after q3off's record.rs).**
- **Decision rows after 0.2.0.** A `clefgguf`: llama.cpp's Clef layout (arch `clef`, head inside the GGUF;
  ggml-org/Clef-Flash-GGUF), after llama.cpp #29831 merges, ~360 lines plus one agreement box run. B: Kev-4B and lev
  rows (head in the GGUF or the LM head's label logits; tied output; `cls.output` role), ~820 lines, llama-server as
  the oracle. Both from sysone's report (line3 scratchpad `sysone.md` §6).

### What glmprefetch left (line1, 10-03 — the host union's lane pack prefetch, 07ec8f04)

Sat under the lease (A6000, place a, G2, same binary, 4 rounds, pp4096 only, clean): on / off +0.78 % [lower bound
+0.47 %], a noninf pass (`docs/cards/glmprefetch-ab.card`); the pack's stall was mostly not raw-row latency.

- **Flip `LANE_PREFETCH_DEFAULT` to on (XS, levers)**: the claim is under 1 %, so it needs an A/A arm beside the
  on/off pair, and the flip reaches V4.1's lane downs, so a V4.1 noninf sitting (`generate_ds41` acting on the lever,
  one line) first. The bits do not move.

### What glmswap left (line1, 10-02 — GLM-5.3's prompt front on the GEMM, 0a4c2d68)

Sat under the lease (A6000, place a, G1, 2 rounds, no void rows): pp512 93.98 → 128.44 tok/s (+36.7 %), pp4096
91.87 → 124.99 (+36.0 %), inside H1's +34..+42 % (`docs/cards/glmswap-pp.card`). Round `glmgemm2` takes the latent
heads and the FFNs next.

- **The plan reserves the front alone (M, glmgroup piece 3)**: the prompt batch's other `Bufs`, units and `hsum`
  still come out of the 1 GiB margin.

### What glmpaper-replay left (line1, 10-01 — a Mac replay of GLM residency over the ik router set glm5next-prose)

The replay (24 contexts of 2048, a 512-token prompt kept 0, then the engine's `mid` rule) puts the cold n = 96 arm at
hit 23.1 → 39.5 % and +3…+15 % at the timed prompt, the steady state at +28…+41 % (P 0) and +20…+30 % (P 33); P changes
nothing inside 95 steps [derived]. The one open term is τ, a flip's staging cost on the step, 0.13–0.60 ms
(`docs/cards/glmres-ab.card`).

- **The GLM runner keeps no host-slots column (S, `tools/`)**: `glmarms` (T2) gives `tools/ref/depth-glm5next.sh` the
  `<D>@NAME=VALUE` lever arm and the residency sums, but not the `stat` records, so the card's τ read-out needs the
  timed prompt's host slots from a route trace of ids 50000..50511 + 96 through the replay, or a `stat` column
  ported from depth-qwen3moe.sh (`q38stats`).
- ~~**GLM default P = 0 (XS, after the A/B)**~~ **착지 확인(10-04, glmctx; 절반은 이미 서 있었다)**: 좌석의 미설정 단어는
  glmseat(`f8c57c86`)부터 이미 `mid-p0-s1`이었다 — A/B(`glmres-ab.card`)의 decide-in이 확인만 했고, `generate_glm5next`의
  미설정은 `off`가 원래 오늘의 설계. 이 회차가 `residency host` 기록의 `pinned=0`과 `headroom_after ≥ 0`를
  gate-gpu-glm5next-serve의 절로 잡는다(뮤턴트: 단어를 `mid-p33-s1`로 되돌리면 빨강). 풀이 20.2 → 39.7 GB로 자라는 것은
  계획의 host 항 안에 있다: `glm_residency_at_plan`이 풀을 headroom·`MemAvailable`에 대보고 못 미치면 `off`와 이유를
  인쇄한다(조용한 적재 없음).
- **Prompt-call pick for GLM (M, the biggest lever)**: V4.1's callstream pick at floor 32 (22 experts a layer, 334 MB
  inside one 86–114 ms layer-batch): n = 96 at 58.3 % hit, +23…+34 %, and the MTP window at 32–34 tok/s [derived];
  floors 16 and 1 overflow the layer-batch.
- **Staging that pauses outside the window (S–M, `crates/gpu/src/host/swap.rs:815`)**: the window is read only when a
  job starts, so ~70 % of a memcpy runs over the host leg; re-reading it per 2 MiB piece could take τ near 0 —
  worth f·τ = 0.7–3.5 ms a step (+1.5…+9 %) [derived]. After τ is measured.
- **A `knee` rule preset (S–M, `crates/runtime/src/swaprule.rs:55`)**: 1.3–1.5 flips a step, steady state +30…+33 %
  at any τ; beats `mid` only when τ > 0.55. After τ is measured.
- **glm5next router set: chunk ≥ 1 routing drifts (S, oracle identity)**: `tools/ref/router_trace.cpp:442` clears only
  the KV cache between chunks. Engine vs ik id overlap is 95–96 % on chunk 0's late layers and 81–87 % on chunk 1's
  (early layers 98–99 % in both), so the KDA recurrent state may carry across chunks. Re-trace two contexts and
  compare before any gate reads chunk ≥ 1.
- **router-residency.py's `gen` is off the engine's shape by one pass (S)**: the zero arm and steady state run with
  n_l live (no spare), a `Budget(30)` link and no prompt pass (`tools/ref/router-residency.py:655, 750`); give it an
  engine-shape option.

### Upstream rename (10-01, line1)

- **cuda-oxide's repository is now NVIDIA/cuda-rust** (the project and crate names stay; GitHub redirects the old
  URLs, and `git ls-remote https://github.com/NVlabs/cuda-oxide.git` answers). The docs name the new repository
  since `oxrename`. The source URL stays NVlabs for now: `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.dependencies]` and the `[patch]`
  key), `deny.toml` `allow-git`, `crates/oxide-ice-unroll/**/Cargo.toml`, and AGENTS.md's "declared against NVlabs".
  Moving it rewrites `Cargo.lock`'s source strings, so every gate's ledger key moves; it rides the next cuda-oxide
  pin move, which runs every gate anyway. Risk until then: a new repository under the old name would break the
  redirect for a fresh clone.

### What T0 and the 09-30 night left (line3 — `lanea`, `gmerge`, `mtppf`, `mtpcost`, `c4resid`, `resitrun`)

Qwen3.8 on the A6000 plan (a), prose, C 4352 (rig-log 09-30 #q38mtp-speed, #q38res-mtp, #q38mtp-wide): the MTP
draft takes decode from 51.6 to 84.0 tok/s at P 512 and from 52.2 to 68.5 at P 4096, and costs the prompt
3.1 % / 6.1 %. Residency on top gives 85.7 / 70.7 with the prompt at −7.0 % / −9.2 %. With both on, a reply
breaks even against the plain path at about 10 output tokens at P 512 and about 167 at P 4096 [derived].

- **gate-gpu-lib's capture race (investigation, S–M)**: on a card-locked runner it went red once in 4 runs on
  the 3090. Four hw_ tests failed with DriverError 900 "operation not permitted when stream is capturing":
  `hw_host_flag_holds_a_copy_until_raised`, `hw_boundary_gives_back_its_context_handles`,
  `hw_a_capture_body_that_fails_or_panics_leaves_the_stream_capturable` and
  `hw_nodes_report_a_captured_host_function`. The old path failed 0 of 6. The capture mode is THREAD_LOCAL
  (`crates/gpu/src/graph.rs`), and the mechanism is not known. It may become a line in the nvlabs ledger.
  (`lanea`) The red runs came from `tools/gpu-test.sh`, which did not land; main's `tools/gate.sh` path is the
  0-of-6 one. Candidate mechanism (code reading, 10-01, 8a): the lib tests run as threads of one process on device
  0's one primary context, and cuda-core 0.3.1's `DeviceBuffer` drop calls `cuCtxSynchronize` before its async free
  (`simt/device_buffer.rs:163-176`). One test's drop, synchronizing every stream while another test's stream is in a
  THREAD_LOCAL capture, gets 900 and records it as the context handle's sticky error (`record_err`). Discriminator:
  the same binary at `--test-threads=1` against the default, N runs each.
- ~~**callstream teardown segfault (M)**~~ closed by `efc983ea` on code reading (10-01, 8a): the gate runs
  `--place bp` on both cards (`gate_ds41_callstream.rs:3`, the recipe's `BLOOMERY_CARD=both`), the tier's stream
  memops cross the two contexts, and the crash is the model drop's second primary-context release, the stagewin
  mechanism; no `Gpu` drop releases a primary context now. The fault path's teardown has not run since: the next run
  of a faulting mutant (s1's slot read mid-copy) confirms it. (`gmerge`)
- ~~**stagewin teardown segfault**~~ closed by `efc983ea` (2026-10-01): the driver faults in the second
  `cuDevicePrimaryCtxRelease_v2` once one context's stream memops touched a portable host page of the other —
  reproduced without the engine (`docs/upstream/nvlabs-ledger.md` #36, `docs/upstream/ctxrelease-repro.c`). A device's
  primary context is now retained once and released only at exit. The callstream item below ran green in that
  landing batch (gate-gpu-ds41-callstream rc 0, no segfault in any log); re-read it before closing it.
- **t2review leftovers (S each, report `t2review`)**: host_stats' p50 convention; the residency refusal text differs
  between its two owners. (`DeviceTensor::window`'s unchecked product, the `scratch.rs` handle leak and the two
  `check-unsafe.sh` gaps closed in `80e86b6b`.)
- **callstream mutant s3-drop-admitted (S)**: it is caught by s2 and s4, not by s3, and its output is
  byte-identical to s2-acc-first's, so its site may be wrong. (`gmerge`)
- **Qwen3.8 MTP prompt cost after `mtpcost` (M, a placement round)**: at P 4096 the MTP arm's prompt is
  still about 0.43 s slower (pp 616.9 → 579.4). The store walks are no longer the term: `mtpcost` walks 64
  rows wide, so P 4096 runs about 64 walks, about 30 ms at their 0.45–0.6 ms fixed cost each [derived]. A
  graph capture of the walk would win under 1 %. The term is the draft's card reserve: 2.82 GB, 94 % of it
  the draft's 512 Q8_0 experts, moves target experts to the host, host_slots +8.0 % at P 4096 (+6.8 % at
  512). On a prompt union of 4.99 s that is about 0.40 s, nearly all of the rest [derived]. There are two
  levers. C1 requantizes the draft experts (L). C2 lends the draft's expert area to the target during the
  prompt (M–L). `head=full` borrows the target's output, so a smaller head frees no card bytes. The
  catch_up and stepped whole walks can also become store walks (XS). (`mtppf`, `mtpcost`)
- **MTP warm before the last layer's combine (S–M, after MTP phase B)**: on non-last prompt units (the Pass
  path, and a ubatch with P > U), the warm stores rows before the last layer's combine. Acceptance drops,
  and tokens do not change, so gate (w) cannot see it. The fix sites are `MtpDraft<B>::warm`, `prompt` (the
  per-unit warm in the sink) and `catch_up` in `crates/app/src/mtp.rs`.
- **`residency pass` has no hit field (S)**: residency's +3…+7 % per round was below its card band
  (+15…+70), and the hit per window could not be read to say why. Add the hit to the record, and read one
  window before any rule change. (`c4resid`)
- **The Qwen3.8 defaults on the 3090 (M, after the resit's 3090 cells)**: residency and MTP stay off under
  `--place gate` until a 3090 cell measures them.
- **Qwen3.8's deep oracle as a `weekly-*` recipe (XS, the 256k rule, `q38rules`)**: the d32k and d64k CPU dumps
  (`tools/ref/models/qwen4exp.sh:149-153`, 5–8 and 13–21 min [derived], `specs/release/research/longctx-report.md`)
  become one weekly recipe, triggered in `tools/gate-paths.tsv` by the attention, KV and QSA files
  (`crates/gpu/src/{qsa,flash_gqa}.rs`, `crates/runtime/src/{qsa,stores}.rs`, the qwen3moe arch's body and wide
  walks). Serving already goes to the file's 262,144 (`place::serve_ctx`); the verified depth stays D3K's 3,001
  until the weekly sets land, and no landing gate prefills past its depth today.
- **GLM G2: PRIME in the load (M, binary change)**: this is a follow-up of GLM's MTP arm. (`glmmtparm`)
- **gate_deepseek41_tier's lost_case and batch_lost_case (S)**: about 80 % of the two is the same, so one
  helper would serve both. (`gmerge`)
- **recipes.py's self-test names specific recipes (S)**: it breaks on every merge that renames one. (`gmerge`)

### dsres가 남긴 것 (09-29 아침, 03 종이 라운드 — ko-08 목록 + DSpark 잔차)

rig-log 09-29 #chatlist-dspark의 열린 잔차(ko-08 목록 + draft, 예측 54.2, 실측 46.4 tok/s, toktape 클립 값)를 코드와 트레이스로 가른 종이 판정이다. 쌍 패스는 행마다 한 토큰 스텝의 m = 1 체인을 한 A6000 스트림에서 번갈아 치러서(`gpu-deepseek41/src/body.rs`의 `enqueue_pair`, `runtime/src/sched.rs`의 `step_nth`), A6000 직렬 체인이 두 배가 된다. ko-08은 held A6000 적중이 67.7 %여서 쌍 패스의 호스트 수요 20.2 ms가 A6000 30.7 ms 아래로 내려간다. 그러면 벽시계는 max(호스트, A6000) + 결합 손실 2–3 ms + 가장자리다[유도]. 예측식 2Hd + 4.1은 카드를 늘 호스트 그늘로 두어서 이 경우를 놓쳤다. 보고서: `specs/wave-m8/reports/dsres.md`(세션 쪽 사본). 판정은 아래 측정 하나로 닫는다. 레버 판단은 그 결과를 보고 한다(aa).

- **측정(03, 약 8분, 임대)** — 09-30 닫음: ko-08 목록으로 도는 측정이었고 목록과 카드를 삭제했다. 원래 카드는 `docs/cards/dsres-goearly.card`(git 기록). 쌍 패스마다 go를 기다린 호스트 서비스 수(`stat step`의 served − go_early, 80 기준). 카드 가설이면 ko-08 36–71, en-04 8–26이고, draft 사슬 가설이면 ko-08도 26 이하다[유도]. 단일 스텝(served 40)은 구조상 호스트가 늘 go를 기다리므로 쌍 패스 행만 읽는다.
- **Cols(2) 검증, 상태에 따라 고름 (L)**: 쌍을 한 단위·두 열로 돌리고 호스트와 카드 모두 합집합으로 처리한다. ko-08 목록 45.2 → 51.1…54.5 tok/s, en-04는 0 또는 손해다[유도]. 카드에 묶인 상태에서만 이기므로 패스 종류를 상태로 고르는 설계가 필요하다.
- **front 노드 줄이기 (M–L)**: 행·층당 front를 10 µs 줄이면 ko-08 쌍 패스 −0.68 ms, en-04 −0.19 ms다[유도]. 한 토큰 스텝에도 똑같이 듣는다.
- **`take_go`에 기다린 시간 합 (S)**: `gpu/src/host/step.rs`의 `take_go`는 기다린 시간을 알면서 `go_early` 개수와 straggle만 남긴다. `go_wait_ns` 합을 `stat step`에 더하면 카드 노출을 개수가 아니라 시간으로 읽는다.
- **`bloomery-serve-ds41`이 `BLOOMERY_STEP_STATS`를 읽게 (S–M)**: 지금은 `generate_ds41`과 프리필 게이트만 읽어서, 서빙 클립의 잔차에는 호스트 카운터가 없다.
- **bp 스텝 공통 +2.2 ms의 출처 (조사, S–M)**: draft를 끈 bp 스텝 여섯 행이 dsparkfix의 plan (a) 보정보다 한결같이 1.9–2.5 ms 길다. 패스당 공통 항 하나로 맞추면 rms 0.25 ms이지만, 그 항이 패스당인지 방출 토큰당인지, 어디서 오는지는 확인하지 못했다. 측정이 카드 가설을 확정해도 이 항은 남는다.

### 열차 7 파동이 남긴 것 (09-28 오전 — aa `glmsel`·`glmppa`·`q38card`·`adaptres`·`twoeng`·`iktwo`·`swaprule`·`restool`·`toolfix`·`headrows`, 03 `q38gemm32`·`q38wide`·`q38refuse`·`q38hostq51`·목록 id 라운드·`docsprune`, e1 `servedraft`·`qwen3taps`·`q8kdown`)

**착륙 대기 스택**(train 7 뒤 한 열차, add 증명은 새 train 7 팁 기준으로 다시 잰다): `glmsel`(GLM DSA 선택기, 기준 `65d7bbf` → `--onto`), `glmppa`(GLM 배치 프리필, 같은 기준), `toolfix`, `restool`, `swaprule`, 목록 id 라운드, `servedraft`, `qwen3taps`, `probecard`(e1). 충돌 지점: `tools/ref/ptx-shapes.tsv`(glmsel·glmppa·q38card), `tools/check-recipes.sh`(toolfix·restool·slopguard), `place.rs`(q38card·q38wide). `q38card`는 train 8(`q38wide`) 위로 옮기며 `CARD_PLANS`를 arena 항과 함께 다시 유도한다. `q8kdown`(행동 변경)은 그다음 따로: 전체 목록 + 같은 임대 A/B(`q8kdown-ab.card`) + GLM·Qwen3.8 깊이 6 무회귀 행.

**적응형 residency 라운드 계획**(`adaptres` 보고 §7, `specs/wave-r3/reports/adaptres.md`): R1 규칙 `runtime::swaprule`(착륙 대기, 재생 도구 fixture와 교체 단위 일치; 예비 슬롯 S는 V4.1 d = 8에서 2, GLM d = 4에서 1 — 재생 창 적중 +0.6/+1.2점 대 슬롯 비용) → **R2 `slotstate`**: `host/slots.rs`의 용량·live·이동 중 상태와 두 카드의 장치 차원(twoeng R2 `tierslots`)을 한 라운드로 합치고, 장치 슬롯 표 사본 셋(`gpu-deepseek41/src/body.rs:2034`, `gpu-glm5next/src/body.rs:688`, `body38.rs:476`)의 소유자를 `HostTier` 하나로, `SlotMap::on_card`의 범위 밖 조용한 0(`slots.rs:206`)을 이름 붙은 오류로 → R3 V4.1 어댑터 → R4 GLM → R5 여는 재배치(열린 질문 둘: open 뒤 규칙 셈의 시작값, CED 프롬프트의 층별 건너뜀과 `RowMissing`) → R6 Qwen3.8. 박스 탐침 둘: `dma-dram-share`(03 P2), V4.1 16.77 MB 희생자 populate 속도(예측 3–7 GB/s). adaptres의 d = 8 예측은 예비 슬롯 둘을 가정한 재생이었다 — S = 1이면 창 적중 0.7–1.5점 낮다(`restool`).

**두 카드 라운드 계획**(`twoeng` §6): R1 `tierplan`(q38card 착륙 뒤, `placement.rs`), R2는 위 `slotstate`에 합침, R3 `tierkern`(3090 층 그래프·핸드오프·post 엔트리), R4 `tierbatch`(pplbrec 뒤), R5 `tierwire`(`Place::Bp`, 폴트 합치기, `CardLost`, 러너 수락 — servedraft 뒤), R6 두 카드 시팅(사용자 승인 필요). 드래프트 카드: (b′)면 3090, (b)면 A6000.

**Qwen3.8**: `q38wide`(배치 프리필, 예측 pp512 368–457·pp4096 398–494[유도] 대 pass 약 104) 창 4와 시간 측정은 train 7 뒤. ubatch arena(U = 4096에 2.84 GB)가 디코드 로드에서도 카드를 잡아 층당 카드 expert 약 22개를 밀어낸다 — "arena를 U 레버로 잡기"(S)는 D1b의 선행 조건, 별칭 공유(M, 약 1 GB)는 그 뒤. D1b는 `plan()` 기본값을 카드로 뒤집고 `qwen4exp_mtp_meta.rs:265` 핀을 같이 고친다. Qwen3.8 down은 열당 약 3.5 µs로 설계 가정 1.5–2.3의 두 배였다(q38hostq51의 발견). **R4 `q38stream` 재가격**(09-28, 종이 라운드 `q38streamd`, `specs/wave-m8/reports/q38streamd.md`): q38pfd는 전부 호스트 A6000, pinned 26.28 GB/s, union c 3.6–4.6 µs, 코퍼스 순위의 층 앞 prefetch로 pp4096 1,559–1,663[유도]을 냈다. 정정: 스테이징 링은 union 옆 21.19 GB/s, union은 a ≈ 0, c 6.9 µs/열(타일 5.15)이고(rig-log 09-28#q38-union, #q38-dram-share), 목록 없는 동적 집합이면 같은 배치에서 1,062–1,276[유도]이다. (b)에서는 U = 4096에 expert 하나가 호스트 410 µs 대 카드 17–26 µs라 층당 호스트 expert가 12–22개를 넘으면 호스트가 묶고, 호스트 전용 5층(2·4·30·46·47)은 늘 묶는다. R4 없이 b43 pp512 1,225–1,372, pp4096 1,236–1,351, R4(이 ubatch의 카운트 ≥ m*, m* 21.0 / 타일 28.2) pp4096 +51…+85 %[유도]다. pp512는 균등 라우팅이면 +0 %, 편중이면 +12…+58 %라 Qwen3.8 512창의 m ≥ m* 슬롯 몫 한 항에 걸린다(`docs/cards/q38route-mstar.card`, `just trace-router-qwen4exp`). 순서: (b)의 ubatch 카드 레그(D1b, q38two, 상주 expert의 ubatch 카드 route)가 먼저, R4는 그 위 증분이다. 링은 복사 차선 하나에 목적지 둘(residency spare와 층 간 임시 카드 링 0.3–0.7 GB)로 aa가 승인했고, 차선 분리는 slotfix 착륙 뒤 이동 클래스 라운드로 따로, 집합 규칙은 `crates/runtime`의 순수 함수 `stream_set`(정렬 도우미의 주인은 swaprule)이다. PLE 호스트 준비(`PleHost::fill`, U = 4096에 12–27 ms[유도], 벽시계의 0.4–2.0 %)는 임계 경로 위지만 묶지 않는다. 타이머가 없어 `q38ple-prep.card`(calibration)를 다음 Qwen3.8 프리필 시팅 후보로 둔다. 그 안의 스칼라 `dequant_iq4_nl`(`crates/gguf/src/quant.rs:984`, 오라클용 "Scalar on purpose")이 엔진 핫 경로에 쓰인다 — 엔진 쪽 SIMD 변형, 스칼라는 게이트로(S).

**Defaults (user decision 2026-09-30, round `defaults`).** From this commit on, a V4.1 a/bp row runs residency + streaming (`BLOOMERY_RESIDENCY` unset is `mid-p40-s1` under `--place a` and `bp`, off under `gate`, beside `BLOOMERY_CHECK_FINITE=1`, `BLOOMERY_ROUTE_TRACE` and `BLOOMERY_PREFILL=steps`; `BLOOMERY_HOSTSTREAM` follows it) and a qwen4exp row runs card experts (`BLOOMERY_QWEN38_EXPERTS` unset is `card`) unless it says otherwise; such rows do not share a table with earlier rows. The same-binary arms are `@BLOOMERY_RESIDENCY=off` and `@BLOOMERY_QWEN38_EXPERTS=host`.

**GLM**: 배치 프리필 시간 측정 쌍 `glmppa-pp.card`(7–11분, glmwarm 러너 위). R2 제안: 층별 체크포인트 take + G = 2 → pp2048 +20…+27 %[유도]. chunked KDA는 밴드 게이트와 함께 R2 이후. 선택기 절 10은 ik CPU flash가 우리 밴드의 10–30배 밖이라 ik 거리를 출력만 한다 — ik 오차 모델(f16 누산)을 유도하면 단언으로 되돌린다(M).

**V4.1 빈도 목록 (사용자 결정 09-28; 09-30 기능 삭제, 사용자).** 코퍼스에서 배운 빈도 목록은 기본값에서 뺀다. 기본 배치는 id 접두(목록 없음)이고, 공개 헤드라인은 이 기본값으로 잰다. 방향은 사용자별 사용 프로필이다. 엔진이 자기 라우터 선택을 층마다 384개 카운트로 세고(디코드와 프리필 모두, 호스트가 이미 id를 갖고 있다), 다음 로드가 그 카운트로 순위를 매긴다. 재배치는 로드 때만 하고 생성 중에는 바꾸지 않으므로, 동시 세션은 같은 카운트에 더해질 뿐이다. 공개하는 "사용 N토큰 뒤" 행은 held-out으로 잰다: 대화 앞 절반으로 배우고 뒤 절반에서 잰다. 설계 라운드는 e1이 아래 숫자가 나온 뒤 연다. 384개 빈도 목록 파일로 돈 과거 prose·code 행은 목록이 같은 코퍼스에서 배웠으므로 in-sample이다. rig-log의 그 행들에 선을 긋고 "목록 in-sample" 주를 단다(e1). lcg 행은 잰 그대로 두지만 실사용 헤드라인이 아니다. 지금 정직한 채팅 디코드는 A6000에서 약 26–27 tok/s다[손 계측 진단, 임대 없음, e1 hotdiag]. 03의 조각 D: D1은 공개 파일 목록(공개 파일 시드 목록)을 제품으로 만들지 않고, 파일·빌드 분리(`router-attr.card`, 4k 추적 둘: 우리 엔진의 라우팅이 ik와 맞는지)만 남는다. D2는 라운드 `routetrace`가 받았다. 엔진이 자기 라우팅을 위치마다 라우터 세트 형식으로 쓰는 상설 계측기(레버 하나, 끄면 스텝 비용 0)를 만들고, 자체 작성 프롬프트 48개(한국어 20, 영어 14, 코드 14, 프롬프트 단위 learn/held 교대)의 greedy 응답을 `bloomery-serve-ds41`로 추적한다. 이 추적은 온라인 캐시(사용자 승인, 교체 규칙은 `swaprule`의 Strata mid)의 상수를 e1이 재생으로 정하는 측정 입력일 뿐이고, 여기서 목록을 배우지 않는다. GLM의 `hot` 팔도 같은 규칙을 따른다. GLM 빈도 목록 파일은 `glm5next-prose`의 앞 50,000토큰으로 배웠고, 잰 프롬프트는 그 뒤 위치에서 시작하므로 위치로는 held-out이다(`GLM_PROSE_FROM`, `docs/fair-measure.md` 4.2). 다만 같은 코퍼스 안이라 in-domain 적중이다(V4.1 재생에서 in-domain 64–77 % 대 cross 39–50 %, `ideaverify`). 그래서 GLM 공개 헤드라인도 목록 없는 기본값으로 재고, `hot` 행은 in-domain 주를 달아 따로 둔다. 클립(toktape)은 serve + DSpark(servedraft)로 지금 구성에서도 찍을 수 있고, 드래프트가 켜지면 temperature > 0은 이름 붙은 400이라 `--temp 0`.

**도구·게이트 (각 한 줄)**
- `router-coverage.py`·목록 작성기의 모델 정체성 basename 비교 → 첫 샤드 전체 경로(toolfix·목록 id 라운드가 닫음).

- `timing-card.sh` 두 카드 모드가 `srv` 팔을 거부해 두 카드 공개 표에서 fair-measure §1.1을 못 지킨다(S–M, e1); 참조 팔 두 카드 모드·3090 캡·클록 증인 없음(S); `ik-draft.sh:208-215` 워밍업·`[cold]` 없음(S); `deepseek41.sh:43-58,68`·`ik-draft.sh:65` llama-cli `--n-cpu-moe`는 마지막 N층(주석 정정, XS).

### 열차 6이 남긴 것 (09-28 새벽 — 03 `q8qdot`·`q38load` 0–3·`poolord`·`hcspill`·`q8wrap`·`q38prog` B + P1/P2/P8, aa `glmforced`·`kvckpt`·`kvgate`·`kvhost`·`glmcard`·`glmtime`·`glmfit`, e1 `modelkey`·`toolsdedup`·`fitarm`·`q3cold` — 50커밋)

- **게이트 공백·잠정 핀**
  - `gate_qwen4exp_e2e`의 `FLIP_ERR_CAP = 2.0`은 `[잠정 — 백로그]` 핀이다. 깨끗한 실행의 허용 flip 최대 오차 0.942와 m06(PLE 생략)의 4.69 사이에 둔 것이다. 코시-슈바르츠 한계는 약 √2560배 느슨해 유도하지 못했다. Qwen3.8 강제 팔로 flip을 아는 한계를 유도해 이 핀을 대체한다(M).
  - GLM free 절도 같은 형태로 맞춘다. 공유 도우미는 `crates/gpu-gates`에 두고, 상한은 GLM 자신의 로그에서 정한다. `glmfix` 8번이 맡는다.
  - q38prog 변이 14개 중 m01은 m03의 첫 캡처 중단에 가려 따로 관측되지 않았다. 그 절 (s)는 m06(1146 ≠ 1151)이 빨강으로 보였다.
  - glmcard M5(back이 카드층에서도 `sh_y`를 씀)와 kvgate (a)(b)·kvhost `load()` 장치 FAIL-first 넷은 시팅 뒤 변이 창으로 미뤘다. 스크립트는 lead scratch `train6/kvmut.sh`에 있다.
- **도구**
  - `tools/ref/lease.sh:202` `cpu_busy_reading`은 프로세스 수명 평균 `ps pcpu`를 합한다. 그래서 러너 자기 팔이 `[cpu-busy]`로 찍힌다(09-27 v41-ppdepth 전 행). 구간 델타로 재고 자기 pid를 빼야 한다. `pplbrec`이 맡는다(S). 같은 파일 `:79` `CPU_BUSY_COMMS`에는 `generate_glm5next`·`generate_qwen3moe`가 빠져 있다(XS).
  - `depth-ds41.sh`의 `[cold]`는 majflt만 세서 readahead로 들어온 engram 행을 못 본다. 우리 산문 팔에는 engram 예열도 없다(S).
  - `nsys-ds41.sh:51`은 `prose:<P>`를 받지 않는다(S).
  - `router-trace.sh`·`dump.sh`·`dump-draft.sh`가 `ikgit`을 각자 정의한다. 공용 헬퍼 하나로 모은다(XS).
  - `lcpp-fit.sh:48` `lcpp_fit_eng`는 이름을 박아 둬서 러너마다 판별을 따로 둔다(S).
  - 트랙 디렉터리에서 `-C` 없이 git을 부르는 박스 스크립트는 Mac 경로 `.git`에 걸린다(`build-lcpp-pr.sh`에서 실측). check-recipes 검사 후보(XS).
  - `gguf-ranges.py:233` `host_set`은 앞쪽에 dense 층이 있는 모델(GLM 0–2)을 거절한다. 그래서 GLM은 예열을 쓸 수 없다(S).
  - 러너 셋에 `tree_line`·`guard_timing`·`ratio_table`이 복사돼 있다. `tools/ref/tables.sh`로 모은다(S).
  - `check-levers`는 게이트 bin의 `at_main(&[])` 누락을 못 잡는다(glmcard 창에서 GLM 두 게이트가 목록 레버를 거부한 원인, S).
  - `flow/constants.tsv:24` `idx_row_ns` hi는 prefill 청크에서 약 6배 높다. prose union 상수는 r8 이전 값이고, `flow/plans`는 4096에서 끝난다(XS–S).
  - `window-union.py:44` `DEFAULT_RANGES`가 V4.1 층 번호다(XS).
- **엔진**
  - V4.1 `chain/ffn.rs:922`도 `row_off`를 따로 계산한다. `SlotMap::row_offset`으로 옮긴다(S).
  - `gpu-glm5next/src/forced.rs` `ForcedRoute`의 필드를 e2e가 읽지 않는다(S).
  - `indexer.rs:1125` top-k는 청크당 8블록이라 84 SM 중 8개만 쓴다(M). `indexer.rs:1093`은 query를 다시 만든다(M).
  - `body/prefill.rs:1312,1423`: 그룹 끝 fault 읽기와 동기 프롤로그가 카드를 비운다. 256k 사다리 1단 후보다(M).
  - `generate_glm5next`에는 `--arm-sync`가 없어 팔마다 185 GB 호스트 집합을 다시 적재한다(M).
  - `head.rs:30-34`는 norm 이름이 `output_norm`으로 고정돼 있다. MTP `shared_head_norm`용 인자가 필요하다(S).
  - kvckpt `copied()`는 레인이 생기면 커밋된 레인을 복사해야 한다. `glmpair`와 함께 처리한다(S).
- **데이터·문서**
  - `corpus-prose.ids`는 75,268 ids라 128k·256k 산문 프롬프트가 없다(XS–S).
  - ctx256k 보고의 "256k 여유 0.35 GB"는 배치가 KV를 먼저 뺀다는 것을 놓쳤다. 실제 대가는 카드 expert 약 44개다(XS).
- **업스트림 후보**(FAIL-first·중복 점검 먼저)
  - exllamav3 `moe_cpu_host.py:537`: CPU 워커의 예외가 부모에 `ConnectionResetError`로만 보인다.
- **다음 라운드**(스펙 작성됨, `specs/wave-r3/`)
  - `glmfix`(12항, KDA 복원 스탬프 포함)
  - `pplbrec` → `v41-pplb` 시팅(사용자 승인 09-28)
  - GLM MTP 사슬: `glmmtpref` → 03 `deltalanes` → `glmpair` → `glmmtpload` → `glmmtp`(보고 `glmmtp.md`)
  - V4.1 256k: `candmask` → ~~`candwire`~~ (2251355f에 착지) → `candref` → `shadowlite`

### 열차 6 밤이 남긴 것 (09-28 새벽, 03 — `q8qdot`·`q38load`·`poolord`·`hcspill`·`q8wrap`·`q38prog`·`q36mrs`, 조사 `strataread`·`enginesurvey`·`q38mtpd`)

- **Qwen3.8 게이트** (`gate_qwen4exp_e2e`)
  - flip을 반영한 밴드를 강제 arm으로 유도한다(M). (t) 로짓 행은 동점 판정에만 쓰고, (c) flip 허용은 `FLIP_ERR_CAP` 2.0 `[잠정 — 백로그]`로 막아 두었다(`9eccbea`, `e12f17c`). 두 값 모두 유도가 아니라 측정 경계다. 층 0–2의 flip이 거의 모든 출력을 경로 밖 밴드에서 빼는 것도 같은 라운드가 닫는다. GLM의 free 절(glmfix 8)과 같은 모양으로 한다.
  - m01 단독 실행(XS, 박스 약 220 s). W3에서 m03이 먼저 중단해 가려졌다. 그 절((s) 노드 수)은 m06이 빨강으로 증명했다. 교훈: 중단형 뮤턴트는 단독으로 돌리거나 맨 뒤에 둔다.
  - `Flip.pairs`의 맨 튜플 `(u32, u32, f64, f64)`을 이름 붙은 구조체로 바꾼다(S). gap과 err가 뒤바뀌지 않게 한다.
  - `qwen4exp_host.rs:237`: `host::layer` 실패가 그 자리에서 panic해 뒤 층의 절을 가린다(XS). check로 기록하고 다음 층으로 넘어간다.
- **Qwen3.8 프로그램**
  - `program38`을 공유 `Program`으로 수렴시킨다(M–L). `program.rs:93-94`의 Port를 제네릭으로 하고, `dispatch::layer`에 잔차와 FFN 종류를 넣는다. 이동 클래스이므로 Qwen3와 Qwen3.6의 ptx·노드 수·e2e가 모두 동일해야 한다. layerprog §0 항목 7을 오늘은 어겼다.
  - `body38.rs` `refresh`: `copy_from_host`가 스텝마다 스트림을 동기화한다(S, 토큰당 0.1 ms 미만 [유도]). 비동기 pinned 복사로 바꾼다.
  - `PleHost::fill`: IQ4_NL 16행을 직렬로 읽는다. 캐시가 차가우면 0.1–1.6 ms/토큰이다(M). 한 스텝 앞서 읽거나 WILLNEED를 쓴다.
  - m02 경로가 날것의 `DriverError(900, capturing)`로 올라온다(S). 캡처 중 호스트 복사를 이름으로 거부한다.
  - `crates/gpu/src/gemm/mod.rs:53` `GEMM_MAX_SLOTS` = 4096 × 9는 Qwen3.6 기준이다. Qwen3.8의 공유 expert는 Q8_0이라 routed 스택에 합칠 수 없으므로 카드 GEMM은 토큰당 10슬롯이고 U ≤ 3,686에서 막힌다(q38pfd). U = 4096은 route 표를 2,048토큰 반쪽 둘로 나눠 지난다. 상수가 `gemm_route` 장치 코드 안에 있어 올리면 Qwen3.6 PTX가 움직이므로, 런치 인자로 옮기는 것이 따로 남는다(S). q38ub의 입력이다(XS).
- **`q38fix` 착륙** (커밋 `0ea39a9`, 브랜치 `q38fix`, base `49b350e`; Mac 단계 녹색, clippy 48; 시팅 뒤 aa의 묶음에 넣는다. 게이트 목록은 `reports/q38fix.md` §5)
  - 남은 것:
    - `engram/src/hash/ngram.rs:141` `History`에 손으로 쓴 `clone_from`을 둔다. derive는 할당을 없애지 못한다(XS).
    - `model/src/moe.rs:1172`: `UnionScratch`가 폭을 넘는 호출을 잘라 돌리는데(`cut_calls`), 이것이 조용한 실패인지 확인한다(S).
    - `model.rs:607` `run_tokens`에서 `step(&[1, IMAGE])`는 첫 토큰을 진행한 뒤에 거부한다(S).
    - `gate_qwen4exp_e2e.rs:958` (r) 절을 여러 pass로 넓힌다(step `[1, IMAGE]`, pass `[1;8]++[IMAGE]`). 이것이 mutant-5b의 FAIL-first다(S).
    - `head.rs:162` Q8_0 lm_head가 쓰지 않는 `act`를 할당한다(S).
    - `set_probe`의 `graphs.clear()`를 `drop_captures`로 옮기고, 아무도 쓰지 않는 `place.rs:34` `pub use`를 지운다(XS).
    - `PassRecord`와 `RowsParams`를 `scratch.rs`로 합친다(M).
  - mutant 1·3·4는 도달하는 게이트가 없다. 공개 API로 닿지 않는 거부라서 FAIL-first를 증명할 수 없고, 이 사실을 기록으로 남긴다.
- **(처분 전 원본) q38review의 발견 20건**
  - 정확성과 조용한 실패:
    - `body38.rs:574` `set_taps`가 `pub`이고 캡처된 그래프를 버리지 않는다(①). 무장한 채 캡처한 뒤 해제하면 replay가 해제된 메모리에 쓴다. 게이트의 지금 순서는 안전하다. `taps35.rs:322`처럼 `set_mode(Eager)`를 먼저 부르는 `set_layer_taps`로 옮기고, 뿌리인 `model.rs:756` `body_parts`도 같이 본다.
    - `stores.rs:22`에서 conv·taps가 0이면 `− 1`이 랩한다. 그 뿌리인 `hparams.rs:230`은 `ssm.conv_kernel`을 `positive`로 읽지 않는다.
    - `run.rs` `prepare_union`이 더 큰 `cols`에도 `Ok`를 돌려준다.
    - `program38.rs:835` `Pass38::head`가 m = 0을 이름으로 거부하지 않는다(형제 `program.rs:165`는 거부).
    - `body38.rs:771` `prompt38`은 이미지 placeholder를 미리 검사하지 않아, 거부된 뒤 Pass와 Step의 상태가 갈린다.
  - 한 소유자:
    - `place.rs:219`의 선택 층 바이트가 `stores.rs`의 식을 쓰지 않는다.
    - `coverage.rs:325,541`의 Qwen3.8 행이 plan38보다 넓게 받는다(GQA 인스턴스, IMROPE 섹션 합, BF16). IMROPE 판정이 네 곳에 있으니 술어 하나로 모은다.
  - 주석:
    - `fault.rs:329` QWEN35MOE 사이트 순서가 Qwen3.8의 실제 순서와 다르고, `qsa_key_append`의 PoolSelect 설명이 좁다.
    - `body38.rs:58`, `gate_qwen4exp_e2e.rs:15`의 "until P1 lands"는 이미 지난 일이다.
    - `gate_qwen4exp_e2e.rs:163`: selected flash가 두 런치라는 사실과 이력 문장.
    - `head.rs:188` 에러 `what`, `batch.rs` `download_pitched`의 SAFETY 문구.
  - 모양:
    - 튜플 인자 `q38.rs:425,466`, `plan38.rs:208`의 4-튜플, `mod.rs:29`의 `pub`, `body38.rs:209` `hist.clone()`, `place.rs:243` 중복 테스트.
    - 중복 `scratch38.rs:381` `PassRecord` ≈ `body35.rs:174` `RowsParams`, `download_pitched` ≈ `download`.
  - 버리는 것: `front` 125줄(R12, 두 화면 조금 넘음)과 `ALLOWED` 문자열 일치(거부는 조용하지 않음)는 program38 수렴 때 함께 본다. 게이트와 `open_qwen38`은 합치지 않는다(게이트는 독립 판정자).
- **Qwen3.6 게이트** (`gate_qwen35moe_e2e`)
  - (d) 스토어 비율 `PROMPT_RATIO` 2.5 `[잠정 — 백로그]`(`q35ratio`, 09-28)를 유도된 밴드로 바꾼다. 재귀 스토어가 1,024 위치 동안 flip을 적분해, ubatch와 pass의 거리가 pass와 ik의 거리의 0.5–1.4배까지 간다. 측정 비율은 모두 √(1+r²) 이하였다. Qwen3.8의 flip 반영 밴드와 모양이 같으므로 한 라운드로 닫는다.
  - (d)의 비율 절은 한쪽만 본다. 두 팔이 함께 지는 결함(q35ratio m2, 이미지 경로 first=0)에서는 분모가 커져 비율이 0.16으로 떨어졌다. 그 뮤턴트는 (u)가 잡았다. 같은 라운드에서 비율의 바닥이나 pass 팔의 ik 거리 절대 상한을 FAIL-first와 함께 넣는다(S).
- **Qwen3.8 레버** (strataread·q38mtpd 순서 [유도]: 카드 raw Q5_1 → MTP → 적응형 residency → expert별 프리필 규칙)
  - `q38card` raw Q5_1 팔(aa): 슬롯당 3.07 MB로 packed 4.87 MB 대신 파일 바이트를 그대로 쓴다. A6000에 올라가는 비율이 0.385에서 0.59로 늘고, T=1 기준 +5–15 %다.
  - MTP 사슬(03): `mtpread`(0a, Mac 완료, 박스 단계 대기) → `mtprule`(0b) ‖ `mtpmeasure`(0c) → `q38rows` → `mtpload` → `mtpprog` → `mtpwin`. 설계는 `specs/wave-m8/reports/q38mtpd.md`다. 순환 상태 레인은 `deltalanes`(03, `linear/delta.rs`, GDN과 KDA 공유)가 받는다.
  - 적응형 residency: 정책은 `runtime/residency.rs` 한 곳에 둔다. 카운터는 `host/step.rs:718-757`, 교체는 새 `host/swap.rs`다. `SlotMap`에 "in flight" 상태가 필요하다. 먼저 라우터 트레이스를 Mac에서 재생해 판정한다(`router-trace.sh`가 qwen4exp를 잡는다). GLM의 가장 큰 항이다.
  - expert별 프리필 규칙: 교차점 c* ≈ 27슬롯 [유도]. 호스트 절반은 이미 `batch.rs:470`의 `exclude`에 있다. 엔진 호출자가 없으니 배선하거나 은퇴시킨다.
  - `cuMemHostRegister`가 `crates/` 어디에도 없다(S). 모든 DMA 레버의 전제이고, 없으면 pageable 14.4 GB/s다. 약 210 GB 등록 비용을 재는 프로브를 함께 둔다.
- **q8qdot**
  - Q8_0의 −128 wrap이 ik와 패리티가 맞는지 보이게 한다(S). `tools/ref/q8f0_ref.cpp`에 단위 스케일 −128 열을 만들어 gate B가 wrap을 보게 한다. gate A 쪽은 `012a854`가 닫았다.
  - `dot_row`의 Q8_0 AVX2 팔을 빼면 `_ =>` 미러로 조용히 떨어진다(S). 속도만 느려지고 값 게이트는 못 잡는다. 이름 붙은 거부나 커널 존재 단언으로 막는다.
  - `quant.rs:1119` q8_2_x4 왕복이 포화하지 않는다. `qdot/lib.rs:3406` Q5_1 꼬리 `corr*0.25`가 비대칭이다(각 XS, 먼저 읽기).
- **스필·ptx 도구**
  - `tools/ref/ptx-shapes.tsv:2` 머리글이 spill을 "stores"라고 적지만, 실제는 저장과 적재의 합이다(`ptx-scan.sh:88`; 80 = STL 10 + LDL 10 × 4 B). XS.
  - hcspill의 `lds.sh`를 `tools/`로 올린다(S, e1). ptx-scan에 `ld.shared`·SASS `LDS`/`STL`/`LDL` 열을 더한다.
  - `ds41_attn_seg_stage` 8 B 스필을 hcspill과 같은 방식(합쳐진 로드의 생존 구간)으로 종이 확인한다(S).
  - `hc_gated.rs:510` `launch_bounds(512, 2)` + k 바깥 순서로 2 블록/SM(S–M, 기하 부류, 토큰당 0.1 ms 이하 [유도]).
- **게이트 하니스**
  - Mac 단계만 거친 라운드의 새 게이트 절이 착륙 묶음에서 처음 돌았고, 열차 6에서 둘이 빨갛게 나왔다. `q35ubi`의 (d)는 예측이 빗나갔고, `q38ple`의 rollback은 참조가 다른 층의 탭을 썼다. 새 절을 처음 박스에서 돌리는 일을 착륙 묶음보다 앞에 둘지 정한다. 예를 들면 라운드마다 박스 스모크를 한 번 돌리거나, `--round-ledger`에 녹색 기록이 없는 새 게이트는 묶음이 거부하게 한다(S).
  - `gate_deepseek41_prefill.rs:442` handoff·places 절은 카드와 합성 입력만 쓰는데 V4.1 전체를 적재한다(S–M). 적재 없는 게이트로 떼어 낸다. 뮤턴트 그룹당 약 150 s가 적재다.
  - `gate-qwen4exp-meta`의 `&&` 연쇄는 `mtpread`가 rc 수집으로 고쳤다(착륙 대기).
  - `spec_fail_first.rs:24-29`: AVAILABLE `at` 유일성을 전체 행에 대해 검사하는 lib 테스트를 둔다(S).
  - `tools/check-arch.sh` 규칙 ①이 패밀리 자신의 `model::arch::qwen35moe`까지 외부로 센다(S). 그래서 plan38·program38·body38에 인라인 경로가 약 40개 생겼다.
- **문서 (XS)**
  - `hybrid.md:43`, `hybrid-lit-report.md:449`의 "평평한 라우터면 hit ≈ γ(0.23–0.33)"는 09-23 held-out 실측(61–74 % @ 16.7 %)과 FreeToken·JigSaw가 반박한다. 줄을 긋고 정정한다.
  - `facts.md:66`(pageable H2D 14.4 GB/s)과 `plan.md:105`(21.2)를 맞춘다.
  - `session-design.md:371` 체크포인트를 프롬프트 끝이 아니라 특수 토큰 경계에 둔다(OpenCode·OpenClaw의 편집 위치). 복원 게이트에 쓰이지 않은 0 상태 사례를 넣는다(aa glmfix 12).
  - `plan.md:12` DSpark 1.4–1.5× 예측이 09-24 k-rows 선형 법칙 위에 있는지 확인한다. 두 외부 실측(JigSaw +17–20 %, ox-boost 순손실)이 오프로드에서 작다고 한다.
  - ~~빈도 목록의 깊이 드리프트: 목록은 25k 토큰 절반에서 배웠다. 깊이 4096 이상의 hit를 재지 않았다(exllamav3 #315: 앞 문맥만 바뀌어도 cold 20.8 → 28.6 %). 같은 재생으로 잰다.~~ 09-30 목록 삭제로 닫음.
  - `~/opt/bloomery-mac-env.sh`가 호출자의 `T` 변수를 덮어쓴다(XS, 두 번 당함).

### 출시 트랙이 남긴 것 (09-27, e1 — `relrunner`, `soak`, 창 1)

- **V4.1 교차 엔진 표가 비어 있다**(rig-log 09-27#v41-xeng, #e21-3090). 참조 팔을 예열해도 llama.cpp 행이 모두 차가웠다(pp512 73–76 tok/s, 폴트 17–19만, `-r 2`의 둘째 반복까지 차가움). 공개 표에는 09-25 아침 값을 조건과 함께 둔다. 원인과 공정한 창의 설계는 조사 라운드 `memfit`(비행 중)이 낸다. 후보는 r8 사이드카 페이지, llama.cpp 적재의 WILLNEED 262.7 GB, 예열이 넣지 않은 engram 페이지다. r8 뒤 배치 (a)의 우리 pp512도 두 바퀴 다 차가웠다. 우리 호스트 작업 집합이 캐시를 넘는지가 같은 조사에 있다(03 영역과 닿는다).
- **soak 30분**은 aa의 열차 2 뒤 틈에 돈다(`just soak-ds41 30`, 약 34분[유도]).

- **서빙의 호스트 집합이 잠기지 않는다**(soak 보고). `bloomery-serve-ds41`는 배치 (a)에서 `BLOOMERY_HOST_LOCK`을 켜지 않는다. 3분 soak의 warm-up 동안 파일 기반 호스트 expert 페이지 약 34 GB가 회수됐다가 다시 폴트로 읽혔다(RssFile 209 → 175 → 195 GB). 호스트 집합 214 GB와 r8 사이드카 128.7 GB가 251 GiB 박스에 함께 올라 있다. 다른 트랙의 적재 때문인지, 서빙 작업 집합이 램을 넘어서인지는 이 자료로 가를 수 없다. 서빙 바이너리의 기본값을 잠금으로 둘지는 사용자 결정이다(S).
- 서버가 연결마다 스레드를 상한 없이 만든다(`crates/serve/src/api.rs` 연결 수락 루프, S). temperature > 0에서 토큰마다 n_vocab 크기 `Vec`를 새로 잡는다(`crates/gpu-gates/src/bind.rs`의 `logits()`, 버퍼 재사용, S). 위치 상한을 넘는 요청이 엔진 오류가 되어 서버 전체가 exit 70으로 끝난다. 요청 검증에서 400으로 거절하면 클라이언트 실수 하나로 서버가 죽지 않는다(`body.rs`의 `check_defined`, S).
- 러너(relrunner): 예열의 둘째 패스(캐시에서 4–7 s로 호스트 집합을 활성 목록에 올린다)는 MGLRU에서의 효과를 종이로 못 정해 넣지 않았다. 첫 시팅의 잔여 `majflt`가 판단 근거다(XS). `depth-ds41.sh` 머리의 "V4.1's ours is one decode step per token today"는 `43cd107` 뒤로 틀렸다(XS). `generate_ds41.rs` 머리의 `--place a` "the one the timing runners use"도 이제 gate가 있어 낡았다(XS). `majflt`는 기계 전체 카운터라고 행에 밝힌다(XS). `ref_cmd`가 빈 `REF_ENV`에서 공백 두 칸(XS). `tools/ref/depth-ds41-stub.sh`(러너의 박스 자체 시험)는 아무 검사도 부르지 않는다 — `check-recipes`에 박스 단계가 없으니, 러너를 바꾸는 라운드의 증명 목록에 넣는다(XS).

### 03 재구성이 남긴 것 (09-27, `q3prune`·`q3rope`)

- **착륙 기록.** 묶음 1(09-27 새벽): `q3prune`(`fca8171`), `q3rope`(`ade3f76`), `sass_inflight.py`(`2997a58`, q3gemmd에서 도구만). 커널은 지운 `qwen3moe_router` 엔트리 말고 움직이지 않았다. q3prune의 ptx-scan 여섯 바이너리는 base `a229bfa`와 그 행·md5 줄만 다르고(번들 −16,152 B), q3rope의 두 바이너리는 base `e4c501a`와 같다. 두 base와 지금 main 사이 기기 코드 변경은 두 라운드의 diff와 파일이 겹치지 않아 합성으로 읽었다. 착륙 트리를 다시 스캔하지는 않았고, `gate-ptx-spill`은 generate_ds41·gate_e2e의 엔트리 집합과 spill만 본다. 묶음(`tools/gate-batch.sh` 두 레인, 벽시계 370 s)은 15개 모두 rc 0, lint 133 그대로였다. 묶음은 `2b461b3` 위 트리에서 돌았고, 그 뒤 main이 문서 한 줄(`56eaab6`)만큼 움직여 그 위로 리베이스했다(코드 diff 0). 돌린 것은 qwen3moe-meta·router·experts·flash·e2e(두 팔)·gpu-gemm·ptx-spill과 정적 여덟이다. 뺀 것은 V2-Lite p-게이트, V4.1·DSpark 게이트, qwen3moe-qknorm·rope·down, model 크레이트의 Qwen3 밖 게이트다. 이들의 코드는 바뀌지 않았고 `just check`가 모든 타깃을 컴파일한다.
- **gemmsplit 착륙**(`760825c`, 09-27 아침, 묶음 2). 묶음 2(`tools/gate-batch.sh`, 12항목)는 11개가 첫 실행에 rc 0이었고, `gate-gpu-qwen3moe-e2e` 하나가 A6000의 `out of memory`로 빨갛게 끝났다. r8land 라운드의 두 카드 `stage-gpu-load-v41`이 3090 게이트 락만 잡은 채 A6000을 31.7 GB 들고 있었다(트리아지의 두 락 모드 결함 — aa의 lockfix `b437046`이 닫았다). 카드가 빈 것을 확인하고 단독으로 다시 돌려 rc 0(152 s)이었고, lint는 133이다. `gemm.rs`(2,415줄)를 주인별로 `gemm/` 여섯 파일로 나눴다: `kernels.rs`(`#[cuda_module]` 하나와 `#[kernel]` 엔트리 여섯 — 모듈 로드 수 21 그대로), `grouped.rs`, `route.rs`, `swiglu.rs`, `act.rs`, `mod.rs`(재수출). 엔트리 머리는 `gemm_block!` 하나, 타일 워드는 `tile_word`/`tile_parts`, 슈퍼블록 크기·오프셋은 이름 붙은 상수와 const assert, `enqueue_gemm`은 `GemmArgs` + `GemmLaunch::check`(거부 문구 18개 순서 그대로)다. 증명은 이동 급이다: ptx-scan 여섯 바이너리의 행·md5가 base `f7d6ee0`과 같고(번들 +22 B는 `__shared_mem_N` 번호와 선언 순서), 리드가 두 번들을 ptxas로 컴파일해 SASS를 대조했더니 GEMM 계열 15함수가 명령 단위로 같았다(나머지 6함수는 상수 뱅크 4 슬롯 번호만 다름 — 공유 메모리 배치는 안 움직였다). 게이트 셋 판정 줄과 ubatch 덤프 md5 여섯도 같다. 계약(`requires`)은 매크로로 옮기지 못했다(nvlabs 원장 #28·#29). 옛 `gemm.rs` 줄과 새 파일의 대응은 라운드 보고(스펙 폴더 wave-m7 `report-gemmsplit.md` §1)에 있다. 넘긴 것: `q3pp.py:142–143`의 낡은 정규식(q3rope 뒤 `flash_consts`가 main에서도 exit 3; `q3input`에 넣음, XS), Q6_K 오프셋·크기 사본 셋(`lib.rs`, `q6k_sel.rs`, `gemm/grouped.rs` — 주인 하나를 `cores.rs`의 `q6k_dequant` 옆에, S, 커널 라이브러리 라운드), `GgmlType::type_size`가 `const fn`이 아니라 카드 쪽 크기를 파일 리더와 컴파일 시점에 못 묶음(XS), `grouped.rs`의 Q5_K 워드 오프셋과 Q4_K 스테이징 리터럴(R6, XS, q3act C′), `GemmArgs` 이름이 gpu-vision의 것과 겹침(XS, op 라이브러리 라운드).
- **r8land 착륙**(`6b0ec2c` r8host, `1ad6599` r8land, `ea32015` r8review F1, 09-27 아침, 묶음 3). 호스트 티어가 V4.1의 routed gate·up을 r8 사이드카에서 행-레인 타일로 읽는다(`qdot::dot_q3k_r8_cols`). `BLOOMERY_R8`은 등록부의 행이고 기본은 on이며, on·off·main의 비트가 같다. 적재 게이트의 check 4가 사이드카 27,920,531쪽이 상주하는지 확인한다. 호스트 세트는 청크 21개로 걷는다. plan (b)의 190.63 GB populate가 evict 뒤 27.9–28.1 s에 끝났다(런타임 값, 장치 6.83 GB/s가 벽시계를 정함). 사이드카는 모든 줄과 오류에서 경로로 불린다. 묶음 3a(`just affected df44c74` 전체 94항목, lockfix `b437046` 위로 리베이스한 트리)는 모두 rc 0이었다(lint 133, 벽시계 57분). 묶음 3b(정적 여덟, gate-r8, X 레인 셋 — 셋째 커밋을 얹은 트리)에서는 `-lock`이 처음 돌아 녹색이었다: 호스트 세트 190,634,840,064 B를 청크 21개로 5.0 s에 잠갔고(런타임 값), VmLck·파생 페이지 합집합·호스트 세트가 같으며 사이드카 줄은 114,362,494,976 B다(r8land 보고의 계산값과 같음). `gate-gpu-ds41-faults`는 묶음에서 한 스텝 minflt 3(핀 2)으로 빨강이었다. 같은 창에 A6000에 다른 트랙의 compute 프로세스가 있어 `stage-gpu-load-v41`이 rc 75로 여덟 번 재시도했고, 홀드를 올려 단독으로 다시 돌리니 minflt 최대 2로 녹색이었다. 이 핀은 경계값에 붙어 있어 옆 적재에 흔들린다(동시 적재가 잠긴 페이지를 옮긴다는 09-26의 가설과 같은 모양, 여전히 가설 — 핀이나 게이트 배치의 판단은 트리아지 게이트 항목으로). 셋째 커밋은 r8review F1을 막는다. `PageDrop::release_sidecar`에 resident 사이드카를 넘기면 익명 사본에 `MADV_DONTNEED`가 걸려 gate·up이 0으로 읽혔을 것이다. 이제 이름 붙은 오류로 거부한다. 오늘 이 경로로 들어오는 호출자는 없다. gate-r8 절은 수정 전 트리에서 빨강(`got Ok(())`)이었고 수정 뒤 녹색이다. 이 커밋은 3a가 끝난 뒤 올렸다. 이 함수를 부르는 곳은 `gate_load_v41` 하나라서 3b의 두 stage와 정적 검사가 그 증명이다. 묶음 뒤 main이 문서 두 커밋(`973731f`, `31fe26e`)만큼 움직여 그 위로 리베이스했다(코드 diff 0). 디스패치 경로 비용(r8review F14): Rows 경로(off 팔, V2-Lite CPU)에도 쌍마다 비교·나눗셈이 하나씩 늘었다. 스레드당 µs 단위라 layer-batch union 66.7 ms의 0.1 %보다 훨씬 작다[계산값]. 잣대 안이라 카드가 A/B를 거절하므로 재지 않았다. 착륙 뒤 시팅: r8host-pp(on 대 off, P 512·4096, lcg·산문; `docs/cards/r8host-pp.card`, 약 32–33분[계산값])는 사용자 승인을 기다린다.
- **r8review 보고 → 라운드 `r8fix`**(09-27, 03, S–M; 원문 스펙 폴더 wave-m7 `report-r8review.md`, 코드 읽기만). F1(HIGH, 잠재)은 착륙 묶음에서 고쳤다. 나머지 가운데 r8fix가 가져갈 것:
  - F2(MED, 잠재): 사이드카가 어느 source로 검사됐는지 타입이 모른다. 모델 A의 사이드카를 모양이 같은 모델 B의 split과 `build_r8`에 넘기면 조용히 섞인다 → 재사용 표의 `Seen`을 `Sidecar` 안으로 옮기고 `R8Stack::of`가 대조한다.
  - F4(MED): 재사용 판정 `gives`의 건전성이 `check`와 `Inputs::of`가 같은 입력을 따로 모은다는 데 달려 있다 → `check`가 `&Inputs`를 받게 한다. F2와 한 구조 수정이다.
  - F3(MED): 박스에 사이드카가 없으면 step·prefill·chain-ffn·load가 source 대 source로 녹색이 되고, 흔적은 stderr 한 줄뿐이다(조용한 커버리지 손실). → r8을 덮어야 하는 게이트(최소 chain-ffn, `gate_load_v41`)는 `BLOOMERY_R8=off`를 명시하지 않았는데 사이드카가 없으면 이름으로 거부한다. chain-ffn은 aa 파일이라 hunk 목록을 보낸다. 덤으로 `gate-ds41-host`에 `layer_r8` 팔을 두어 ik 밴드와 대조한다.
  - LOW(XS씩): F5 페이지 해제 코어 두 사본, F6 resident 사이드카에서 거짓이 되는 populate·mlock SAFETY 문장, F7 청크 스레드 패닉 때 lock된 span이 풀리지 않음, F8 `HostLayer::layouts` pub과 낡은 doc, F9 `gate_load_v41`의 "the engine's set the same"이 쪽 수만 봄, F10 `w.n / grain`이 격자 밖을 자름(`n % grain == 0` assert), F11 경로의 파일이 교체되면 `(dev, ino)`로 새로 열기, F12 `first_shard`의 `unwrap_or_default()`(이름 붙은 오류로), F13 `PairWork` doc, F15 AVX2+F16C가 필요한 평범한 `#[test]` 셋을 hw로, F16 게이트의 자유 형식 `host_populate=`·`host_lock=` 줄, `host_lock.rs:41-47` sysconf 실패 때 조용히 4096, `r8file.rs:217-230` 맨 파일 이름이면 `.-r8/` 숨김 디렉터리.
  - 다른 라운드로: F17 `hybrid.rs`의 `on_off` 사본과 `flag`의 trim → hostcfg. `bench_v41_host`의 `unionr8` 자체 구현 → benchprune(이미 있음). step 게이트 `swap_effect`와 chain-ffn 게이트의 `Split::open` 재열기 → aa(r8land 보고와 같은 항목).
- **q3rope는 A/B 없이 구조로 착륙했다.** 표 적재가 1,720 µs(ctx 4352, 런타임 값)라 pp4096 계산값이 +0.39…+0.55 %로 두 빌드 잣대 안이다. 근거는 "스텝은 적재 일을 하지 않는다"는 규칙이고, 카드 `q3rope-pp`는 쓰지 않았다.
- **지금 도는 것과 다음.** 착륙 묶음 5가 들어갔다(아래 항목). 원장 31(범위 `for` 언롤)은 포크에서 고쳐 업스트림 [#1346](https://github.com/NVlabs/cuda-oxide/pull/1346)으로 냈고, 메인테이너의 코드 기준(`docs/upstream/cuda-oxide-pr.md` 5절)으로 다시 보면서 실결함 하나를 찾아 고친 판이 올라가 있다. 포크 `bloomery`는 업스트림 main `ec4aa479` 위의 패치 셋(`dcf5636d` requires 상수, `29213c14` 매크로 진단, `c76f1e17` #1346)으로 옮겼고, 옛 핀은 태그 `pin/e589793a`로 남겼다. 지금 도는 것은 라운드 `pinmove`다: bloomery의 핀을 `c76f1e17`로 옮기고 백엔드를 짓고, 업스트림 74커밋이 우리 커널의 무엇을 움직이는지 ptx-scan으로 가른다. 결과에 따라 이동 급 또는 전체 목록으로 착륙한다. 그 뒤가 Qwen3.6 몸체 `q35body`(q35lanes가 준 lane·ring 인터페이스 위, aa의 layerprogdesign과 gpumodel 이름), 그다음 `q35prefill`이다. Qwen3 줄은 kernelshape M2 매크로 모듈 이동, 호스트 줄은 `benchprune` → `hostcfg` → `hostone`이다.
- **`actdesign` 보고**(09-27 새벽, 설계, 메모 `docs/research/act-planes-design.md`, **aa 서명 09-27** — 조건 넷은 메모 §7 끝). 활성값 버퍼의 평면 집합을 적재 때 정한다. 집합은 그 자리 소비자들의 가중치 타입과 경로 계열(gemv·전문가·GEMM)에서 표 하나(`card_reads(ty, Family)`)로 나오고, 커널이 없는 소비자는 적재 때 `Unimplemented`로 한꺼번에 거부된다. 기록기는 집합 안의 평면만 쓰고(평면마다 행 수; 없는 평면은 길이 0 버퍼라 커널 ABI는 그대로), 읽는 쪽은 타입 뷰를 받고, 열 수는 런치 인자가 된다. Qwen3 프롬프트는 층당 117.4 MB, P 4096 한 번에 5.637 GB를 덜 쓰고 pp4096은 +1.88…+1.97 %다[계산값]. 감사의 8–9 ms와 같고, 창이 511 → 442 ms로 줄어 비율만 올랐다. V4.1은 호스트 그늘이라 벽시계 ≈ 0이고, DS2의 선행 조건이다. 이행: A(표, 호스트) → B(`ActPlanes`로 이동, ptx-scan 동일; aa 파일 11개를 기계적으로 바꾸므로 gpumodel 착륙 뒤) → C(기록기 열 곳에 행 수, PTX 이동, A/B 한 번 — 카드 초안은 메모 §6) → C′·E·F. D는 aa의 batchwide가 한다. **사용자 결정(09-27): `gemm_q5k`는 남긴다.** 삭제는 "IMMA 결정 뒤"로 보류돼 있었다(`rebuild.md:302`). 그런데 Qwen3.6-35B-A3B는 routed down이 40층 중 36층, GLM-5.3-Flash UD-Q4_K_XL은 43층 중 40층이 Q5_K라, 지우면 두 새 모델 모두 프롬프트 경로에 down GEMM이 없다. 범위 밖(보고만): 전문가 정렬 순서로 바로 양자화하기(ik `quantize_mmq_q8_1_id`, mistral.rs `mmq_quantize.cu:238`; V4.1의 `ds41_card_gather`와 GEMM의 `acol` 간접 참조를 없앨 레버 후보, 유도 먼저, M), `tensor.rs:191-201`의 `Q8ACT_MAX_SLOTS`가 호스트 유니온 상수를 공용 타입에 박은 것(B에서, XS), Q8Act 크기 공식 사본 다섯(B에서 `ActShape::bytes()` 하나로, S).
- **`hosttier` 보고**(09-27, 설계, 박스 안 씀, 메모 `docs/research/host-tier-design.md`, **aa 서명 09-27** — 1–11·13, 12는 조건부; 조건과 03의 답은 메모 §7 끝). 호스트 티어는 하나(`HostTier`)이고 포트가 둘이다. 스텝용 `StepPort`는 캡처한 그래프 안의 memop으로 넘긴다(exllamav3의 핸드오프 기제를 그래프에 넣은 모양이고, 참조 셋 중 그래프로 잡는 곳은 없다). 배치용 `BatchPort`는 이벤트와 호스트 sync로 넘긴다(ik 스케줄러 모양). 두 벌씩 있던 사실 셋(폴트 판독, `MappedHost`, `capturing`)은 주인을 하나씩만 남긴다. 디코드를 한 열짜리 `UnionCall`로 옮겨도 풀 디스패치 수(2)와 레인 절단은 `serve`와 같고, 다른 둘(steal 블록 상한, claim의 cheap look)은 hostone이 없앤다. 예측 효과가 V4.1 스텝당 −0.01…−0.06 ms(−0.03…−0.19 %)[계산값]라 decode A/B 카드는 `CARD_UNDER_RULER`로 거부된다. 그래서 C 단계는 구조 시험 T1–T7과 비트 동일 게이트로 착륙한다(`rebuild.md` §6-0 ②의 1순위 길 — 03 계획의 "decode A/B 한 번"은 지웠다). 이행은 선행(r8land, hostcfg, benchprune) → A(사실마다 주인 하나, 이동) → B(포트와 배치 기계 이동, gpumodel 뒤) → C(디코드를 union 호출로) → D(삭제: `Entry::Cols`, `matmul_q_group_cols_into`, `exclude`·`excluded_lb`는 스키마 변경) → E(hybridgate)이고, 모두 aa의 DS6·layerprog·batchwide보다 먼저다. **다음 모델에 대한 발견.** GLM-5.3-Flash는 오늘 배치대로면 디코드가 전부 호스트다(토큰당 약 38 ms[계산값], DRAM 바이트 바닥). 호스트 티어 말고 빠진 것은 카드의 routed Q5_K 전문가 커널 하나다. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B는 용량으로는 호스트 티어가 필요 없다(A6000에 파일 22.4 GB가 통째로 들어가고, 3090에도 2–3 GB가 남는다[계산값]). 그런데 Q5_K 스택을 가진 37층을 돌릴 커널이 카드에 없고, qwen 프로그램에는 호스트 티어도 없다(`modelspec-design.md:763`). 두 모델 모두 이 커널이 선행이다 → 카드 routed Q5_K 전문가 gemv는 5파동에서 aa `opslib`의 첫 커널로 간다(두 다음 모델 공통, 유도 먼저 — 기존 Q4_K·Q6_K 전문가 코어의 형제; aa 서명 조건 13). 범위 밖(보고만)의 처분: `ops.rs:3441`·`:3484` claim의 cheap look 부재 → hostone C. `hybrid.rs:1412`·`:1465`·`:2099`의 한 열 x 페이지 복사 → hostone D(`Hybrid.x`, 메모 §2.6). `lib.rs:2253-2278` `Gpu::fault`의 단어별 sync와 `prefill.rs:1920-1924` `fault_or`의 겹친 sync → hostone A(§7-3). `hybrid.rs:1937-1940` 감시 없는 배치 거부가 NaN 행과 `Ok`를 돌려주는 길 → hostone A(§7-7). V4.1 엔진은 늘 감시하고(`body.rs:2259`), 감시 없는 길은 V2-Lite와 `gate_hybrid.rs:882`의 핀뿐이다. `batch.rs:1120`의 늘 빈 `exclude`와 `excluded_lb` → hostone D(스키마 변경, aa 파일). `hybrid.rs:468-485` `MappedHost`의 PORTABLE·Sync → hostone A(§7-4). 전송 계층에 박힌 top-6(`batch.rs:1020`·`:1026`·`:1061`, `ffn.rs:1578-1579`) → hostone B(`n_used` 매개변수, §7-1). `tests/ds41_host.rs`가 `HostScratch`의 f32 결합에 기대는 절 → hostone C(메모 §2.6의 대체 절). `bench_v41_host.rs:1587-1626` engine 팔의 `serve` 재구현 → benchprune. `audit/cpu.md` CPU6의 "빠지는 것" → 09-27 정정했다. ik `-ncmoe` 도움말 → 업스트림 후보, 박스 mistral.rs 트리 → 문서 항목. **aa가 넘긴 것**(del2 검토, 09-27): del2가 `GpuModel`의 launch 카운터를 지우면 `hybrid.rs`의 `first_serve_lag_ns`(`:1167–1171`, `:2006–2010`)와 `ReplayWatch.failed`(`:1373–1379`, `:2031–2036`, 생성자가 늘 `None`)를 읽는 곳이 없다 → 재생 감시 전체가 아무것도 싣지 않으니 인자로 바꾸지 않고 지운다. `gpumodel`(aa)이 `replay_graph`를 다시 쓰면서 `serving_replay` 감싸기를 걷고, `hybrid.rs` 쪽(`ReplayWatch`, `REPLAY`, `serving_replay`, 두 서비스 함수의 `watch` 인자와 지연 합산, `first_serve_lag_ns`)도 이름 붙은 hunk로 가져간다(03 사전 승인, 착륙 전 hunk 목록; 메모 §7 끝). `enum Chain`은 `hybrid.rs`에 두고 hostone B가 `host/step.rs`로 옮긴다 — 그래서 hostcfg는 `model.rs`를 만지지 않고 gpumodel 옆에서 날 수 있다. aa 파일 위의 두 B는 하나씩: q3act B가 먼저, hostone B가 다음.
- **다음 03 라운드로 넘긴 것.**
  - `q3input`: pass 경로의 0 채움과 토큰당 sincosf(`prefill.rs:185–208`, 패스당 ≤ 3.2 µs[유도]), ubatch의 pageable 복사와 sync → pinned 버퍼(`ubatch.rs:307–346`), `prefill.rs:140–142` SAFETY의 drop 순서, `dispatch.rs:325` 스케일 사본, ubatch `enqueue`의 인접 `usize` 둘과 `ctx_max` 사본, `depth-qwen3moe.sh:506` arm 필터가 `stat prompt`를 떨어뜨리는 것과 `:22`·`:137`의 낡은 "ubatches of up to 512"(XS).
  - `q3gates`: `gate_qwen3moe_e2e.rs:162–163` `LONG` 문서가 거짓이다("three ubatch-sized units" — 절 (u)는 기본 크기에서 경계를 넘지 않는다; 문서 XS, 커버리지 S). `gate_qwen3moe_flash.rs:89` PIN-as-history 줄(XS).
  - router 모듈을 여는 다음 라운드(`kernelshape` M2): `router.rs:554`·`:706` SAFETY "as above", `launch_bounds(256)`과 `block`을 `FUSED_THREADS`에 const assert로 묶기, 호출처 없는 `RouterOut::tokens()`, `flash_gqa_prefill.rs`의 `POSITIONS` `pub`(`tools/ref/q3pp.py:123`이 `^pub const`를 정규식으로 읽으니 `(?:pub )?`로 같이 고친다), `fused.rs:527`의 라운드 이름 "P0b"(XS씩).
  - 버림: decode rope refresh(스텝당 ≈ 0.4 µs[유도]).
- **`kernelshape` 보고**(09-26 밤, 설계, 스펙 폴더 wave-m7 `report-kernelshape.md`). 형상 상수가 레지스터 배열·MMA 프래그먼트 역할·smem 배치를 정하는 커널은 넷이다: 플래시 디코드 스칼라·MMA, 프리필, 라우터 `route_warp`. 나머지는 이미 런타임 형상이다. N_USED·NORM_K·rope HEAD는 비용 없이 런타임 인자가 된다. const 제네릭 `#[kernel]`은 이 핀에서 권하지 않는다(정적 `SharedArray` E0401, `requires`에 const 이름 불가, 번들 병합 JIT, 해시 엔트리 이름). 권고는 `#[cuda_module]` 전체를 `macro_rules!`로 인스턴스화하는 것이다. Qwen3 인스턴스의 PTX가 구성상 같아서 `ptx-scan` 동일이 증명이 된다. 이동은 M0–M5이고, M0–M2는 ptx-scan 동일, M3는 비트 동일에 잣대 아래라 시간 A/B가 없다. **M2 매크로 모듈(rustfmt를 포기하고 증명은 ptx-scan 한 번) 대 B′(정렬된 소스를 얻고 비트 게이트와 차이 판정을 치른다)는 탐침 한 번이 가른다(리드 결정 09-27).** M2 라운드는 가장 작은 인스턴스 키 커널 `gqa_flash_seg`(PTX 433줄)를 B′ 모양(const 제네릭 `#[inline(always)]` 몸체와 얇은 비제네릭 엔트리)으로 옮겨 base와 `ptx-scan`을 대조하는 데서 연다. 행과 md5가 같으면 기존 인스턴스를 모두 B′로 옮기고, 증명은 이동 급이다. `tools/ref/ptx-canon.py`가 `reordered-only`를 내고 자원 열이 같으면 삭제 급과 같은 규칙으로 B′를 받는다. 그 밖이면 기존 Qwen3 인스턴스는 M2 매크로 모듈로 가고(증명은 ptx-scan 한 번), B′는 맞출 base가 없는 M5 새 몸체에만 쓴다. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B의 새 형상은 플래시 (HEAD 256, GROUP 8)와 라우터 전문가 256이다(`models-survey.md:104`, `:127`). nvlabs-ledger #20(스칼라 인자 헬퍼 하나만 떼어도 명령열이 바뀐 재현)이 있어 B′가 PTX를 지킨다는 기대는 낮게 잡는다. 탐침은 컴파일 시점 사실이라 박스 실행이 빌드 하나다. **먼저 할 것**: Qwen3를 한 번 열 때 번들 전체를 18번 적재한다 → 한 번 적재하고 `from_module`로 묶어 1번(S–M, `plan-ledger.md:946` "공유 모듈 캐시"와 같은 항목, 인스턴스를 늘리기 전; `ubatch.rs`와 `lib.rs`에 닿으니 gemmsplit과 aa의 del2가 착륙한 뒤). 문서(XS씩): `docs/upstream/nvlabs-ledger.md` #8의 "`launch_bounds`는 리터럴만"은 핀 코드가 const 식을 받는다고 한다(리터럴 전용은 `launch_contract`의 `block`·`dynamic_shared`) — 빌드로 확인한 뒤 정정; `requires`가 const 이름을 못 받는 새 사례 둘(router 계약들, `flash_gqa_prefill` 계약).
- **r8host 보고 → 라운드 `r8land` — 착륙(묶음 3, 위 기록; 넘긴 것 가운데 두 락 모드는 lockfix, 한국어 주석은 착륙 커밋, `unionr8` 팔은 benchprune)**(09-27, 03, opus; 브랜치 `r8host` = main + WIP 한 커밋, 원문 스펙 폴더 wave-m7 `report-r8host.md`). 호스트 티어가 routed gate/up을 r8 사이드카에서 행-레인 타일로 읽는다. 비트는 on = off = main이다. r8land이 남은 것을 가져간다: 레버를 등록부에 올리기(`HostLevers.r8`, Direct [03] — 형제 셋과 함께 `hostcfg`가 옮긴다, aa 동의), 적재 게이트 check 4가 사이드카 몫을 증명하게, `-lock`의 `page_union`을 파일별로, 사이드카 populate를 여러 스레드로(102.4 s → ≈ 53 s[유도]), 오류가 사이드카를 경로로 부르게, 재사용 재검사 한 번으로. 넘긴 것: `bench_v41_host`의 `unionr8` 사본 대신 엔진의 `R8Stack`을 도는 팔(S, `benchprune`), gate-union·gate-r8 레시피의 한국어 주석(리드, r8land 착륙 때).

### 열차 4가 남긴 것 (09-27 밤 — 03 `train4k`·`hostprog` 18개 + aa `q38reader`·`fix3`·`glmops`·`servetpl` + e1 `mac-check`·`mac-test`·`relnotes`·`batchfix`·`serverobust` + 03 `kfix` 넷 + aa `glmref` + 스필 핀 — 34커밋)

- 묶음: 117항목(`just affected`가 고른 105/105 + 정적 7 + ptx-scan 3 + `stage-gpu-load-v41`·`-lock` 이름으로) 모두 녹색, wall 2,420 s, lint 48. 같은 날 먼저 `ce66086`에서 돌린 사전 묶음(116항목, wall 2,602 s)은 113 녹색이었고, 빨강 셋(qwen35moe-e2e 절 (t)의 첫 실행, gpu-lib의 `QWEN35MOE` 순서에 `CacheValue` 빠짐, 핀 전 ptx-spill)을 이 열차의 커밋들이 닫았다. ptx-scan은 4f1bda8 대비 generate_ds41 151 → 169(+18: K 10과 GLM 연산 8), gate_e2e·gate_qwen3moe_e2e 96 → 110(+14)이고, 기존 행과 md5는 하나도 움직이지 않았다. 원장 건너뜀은 0이었다. pin 이동으로 모든 키가 움직인 것은 맞는 결과다. 다만 사전 묶음과 최종 묶음 사이에 호스트 전용 게이트까지 다시 돈 것은 원장 키의 결함이다. `recipes.py` `model_dirs()`가 트리의 `/models/…` 문자열을 전부 모으는데, glmref 시험 픽스처의 가짜 경로와 `tools/ref/models/glm5next.sh`(`/models/glm5next.sh`로 잘못 읽음)가 새로 잡혀 모든 키를 움직였다. e1이 항목별 모델 키로 고친다(열차 5).
- **Qwen3.8(qwen4exp) 첫 프로그램으로 가는 길.** 03 `q38prog`가 지금 있는 팔을 부른다: Sigmoid GDN → `gdn_norm_gate_sigmoid`(glmkda), 그룹 12 → `_256_p4`(q38gqa), 라우터 512/10 → `_512`(q38router), routed Q5_1 down → `q5_1_gemv_sel`(q38exp), 16/48 GDN → 타일 맵. 오늘 Body35의 계획은 Sigmoid GDN과 키 선택이 있는 GQA를 이름으로 거부한다. `q38prog`가 들어오면 이 둘이 팔이 된다. 막는 것은 둘이다. `moe.rs:753` `EXPERTS_INTO_MAX = 8` 때문에 `PageLayout`이 `n_used = 10`을 거부한다(호스트 티어). 카드의 routed Q5_1은 원시 `DevWeight`·`CardFormat` 팔이 필요하다(packed 66.7 GB 대 raw 27.1 GB — aa P1). QSA 선택기(평균 풀 인덱서, 블록 top-k, 선택 블록만 도는 p4 flash)는 03 `q38sel`(K5)이 맡는다. 위치 2,050까지는 QSA가 가시 토큰을 전부 골라 dense GQA와 비트가 같다(`docs/research/qwen4arch-design.md` §3 C). 그래서 첫 프로그램은 그 범위만 돌고 그 너머를 이름으로 거부한다. `q38sel`은 그 한계를 푸는 항목이지 첫 부팅의 선행이 아니다.
- **GLM-5.3-Flash 첫 프로그램으로 가는 길.** 카드 연산 넷(Q8_0 FFN, `hc_pre_q8_0`, 라우터 288/8, NoPE latent와 인덱서 키)과 KDA·sigmoid 게이트 norm이 들어왔다. 남은 것: `ds41_ffn_handoff`(`chain/ffn.rs:221`)의 `N_USED = 6`이 컴파일 상수였다. 03 `slot8`(열차 5, add 급)이 handoff·post(+streams)·card_acc·card_gather에 `_8` 엔트리를 더하고 런처가 `n_used`로 고른다(6은 base 엔트리 그대로, 그 밖은 이름 붙은 `Shape`). GLM 레이어 프로그램은 aa `glmprog`(L, 맥)가 짓는 중이다. `hc_pre_q8_0`는 Own 규칙이라 임계 경로에 서고, 쌍둥이 실측(10.97 µs/런치)으로 토큰당 약 1 ms다[유도]. glmprog 계산서의 한 항이다. ik는 `kr_l`을 `--dsa`에서만 쓴다. 인덱서 키의 ik 밴드는 glmref의 `--dsa` 세트가 있어야 잰다.
- 03 몫: `of_routed`가 카드 `_sel` 커널이 있는지 안 본다. 그래서 커버리지 목록에 K4의 43+5층이 안 보인다. Qwen3.8 5개 층의 카드 Q8_0 `_sel`과 카드 우선 배치는 03 다음 라운드다. `kda_ik`는 glmref 착륙 뒤 레시피로 넣는다(`*ARGS` 통과 또는 레시피 하나). `body35.rs:339`에 (head, group) → 인스턴스 표를 둔다(q38prog). 메인라인 `build_gdn_l2_norm`은 1/√(Σx²+eps)이고 ggml `l2_norm`의 1/max(√Σ, eps)와 다르다. q38prog의 밴드가 이 차이를 이름으로 적는다. justfile의 `gate-gpu-linear`·`gate-gpu-qwen35moe-attn` 주석이 아직 Qwen3.6 모양만 말한다(XS).
- 호스트 티어: `HostCfg`가 `HYBRID_OVERLAP`·`DEFER_QUANT`·`STEAL_BLOCKS`를 은퇴시켰다. 위 「호스트 expert 티어」의 P2 꼬리 항목(`STEAL_BLOCKS` 4/16/64 A/A)은 그 레버가 없어져 돌 수 없다. 꼬리를 다시 볼 때는 `HostTier` 안의 블록 크기로 새 카드를 쓴다. hostab B의 V4.1 쪽(`hostb2`: 배치 기계 하나, `SlotMap`을 `HostTier`로, `impl Port for HostLeg`)은 열차 5다. 그 보고의 제안 둘(배치 포트 `BatchLeg`, handoff `_8`)은 aa가 판정한다.
- glmmut이 남긴 것: cr3 ⓑ `kquant/act.rs:45` `apply`가 모르는 act 코드를 silu로 돈다. 맞는 fault 사이트가 없다(`ExpertId`·`QuantColumn`뿐). 새 사이트 번호가 필요하다(16은 glmmla, 17부터는 03). `gate_kquant` `band_case`는 커널 출력이 비유한이면 FAIL 줄 대신 게이트를 끝내서 뒤 절이 안 보인다(S). `gate_deepseek41_hc` `check_q8_0`는 비융합 제곱 변이(D3)를 7케이스 중 하나로만 잡는다. 제곱 반올림이 드러나는 큰 동적 범위 입력이 필요하다(XS–S). `gate_kquant:1323`이 클램프된 행을 아직 `act::silu_ik`로 센다. 오라클과 같은 `qdot`으로 맞춘다(XS).
- progshape가 남긴 것: `crates/gpu/src/model.rs:590` `replay(1, Chain::Step)` 하드코딩 → 본체 쪽 상수 하나(XS). `ced.rs:259`의 `every`를 `runtime::state::every_position`으로(R2, S). `gate_deepseek41_skew.rs:861` pair memop 순서 손 사본 → `sched::order`에서 유도(S). `ffn.rs:1050` `enqueue_shadowed` 호출자 하나(XS). `affected-gates.sh`가 Cargo.lock 한 줄이나 dev-dep 한 줄에 모든 빌드를 고른다(패키지 단위로, S). check-arch 규칙 ⑤(프로그램이 스케줄 이름을 쓰지 않음)가 없다(XS).
- **착륙 전에 잡은 것 셋.** ① K 라운드의 두 커밋(glmkda, q38gqa)이 공유 몸체를 제네릭으로 만들면서 기존 Qwen3.6 엔트리 다섯(`gdn_conv_prep`, `gdn_norm_gate`, `gqa_flash_seg_256`, `gqa_flash_seg_mma_256`, `gqa_prefill_flash_256`)의 md5를 움직였다. add 급 증명이 서지 않는다. 03 `kfix`가 기존 엔트리를 4f1bda8의 본문으로 되돌렸고(호출 그래프 diff 0), 공유 몸체로 합치는 일은 비트 동일 증명과 Qwen3.6 A/B를 붙여 열차 5 이후에 한다. 같은 자리에서 p4 프리필의 jit_local 24 B가 cuda-oxide 결함으로 드러났다(nvlabs-ledger §12). ② `gate_qwen35moe_e2e`의 스텝 세트 절 (t)는 박스에서 한 번도 돈 적이 없었고, ik가 쓰는 K `[256, n_kv·cells]`·flash V 평면 모양을 몰랐다(03 `c737cd4`, 첫 실행에서 STEP4·D1K argmax가 ik와 같다). ③ `mod bind`(서버 엔진 스레드)의 단위 시험을 어느 게이트도 컴파일하지 않았다(`deepseek41` 피처 뒤). e1이 `gate-ds41-bind`를 더했다.
- **요청 사이 KV 재사용(감사 `kvreuse`, 읽기 전용, 09-27 밤; 보고는 리드 스크래치).** 지금 서빙되는 실모델은 V4.1 하나다. 10턴 채팅에서 토큰 가중 적중률은 thinking off 약 96 %, on 약 83 %[유도]다. 막는 것을 크기순으로 적는다.
  ① **재귀 모델(GLM·Qwen3.6·Qwen3.8)의 keep이 전부 아니면 0(M).** 한 바이트만 달라도 매 턴 전체를 다시 프리필한다. GLM은 reasoning을 돌려주지 않는 흔한 클라이언트에서 적중 0 %다. 엔진이 `prefill` 호출 끝마다 재귀 state와 conv 링의 호스트 체크포인트를 찍고, `keepable(n)`을 n 이하의 가장 큰 체크포인트로 둔다(GLM 152.6 MB, 복원 약 5.8 ms — session-design). 선례는 mainline `server-context.cpp:3549-3575`와 mistral.rs `prefix_cacher.rs`. 재귀 모델을 에이전트 작업에 쓰려면 이것이 최소 조건이다.
  ② **슬롯 하나, 호스트 프롬프트 캐시 없음(M–L).** 다른 접두사 요청 하나가 끼면 다음 턴이 대화 전체를 다시 계산한다(3.5k 약 12 s, 16k 약 56 s). V4.1 `save_state`/`restore_state`와 llama `--cache-ram` 같은 호스트 LRU가 필요하다.
  ③ **V4.1 CED hole(S).** 긴 첫 호출 안의 공유 시스템 프롬프트는 되돌아갈 수 없다. serve가 첫 요청을 첫 user 시작에서 두 호출로 나누면 풀린다(시스템 프롬프트당 +23 % 한 번[유도]).
  ④ 관찰성(XS): `/metrics`에 `prompt_tokens_cached_total`이 없고, `reuse`가 0으로 떨어질 때 남기는 기록도 없다.
  ⑤ 게이트(S): `gate_ds41_serve`에 thinking-on 2턴, 3턴 이상, 128 넘는 응답, 첫 호출 안쪽 분기를 넣는다. 오라클 `kept()`가 hole 규칙을 모른다.
  ⑥ Qwen3 서빙 바인딩(M).
  ~~V4.1의 16,384 서빙 캡도 에이전트 루프를 8–9스텝에서 막는다.~~ 2251355f가 캡을 걷었다. 이제 `--ctx`(기본 32,768)까지 서빙한다.
- 03 `hostsize`가 남긴 것(열차 5): `ops.rs:1896` `GROUP_INLINE=16`이라 Qwen3.8의 한 토큰 호스트 gate/up(짝 20)이 짝별 Flex 목록을 힙으로 넘긴다. 층 호출당 약 6회 할당이라 Qwen3.8에서만 "스텝은 할당하지 않는다"가 깨진다(M, 같은 임대 A/B). `ops.rs:2494` `MAX_DEFER_SLOTS=16`은 n_used ≥ 17이면 비트는 같지만 느린 사전 패스를 조용히 탄다. 적재 때 이름으로 알린다(S). `host/batch.rs:394` 배치 목록은 적재 때가 아니라 첫 최대 배치에서 자란다(S). `moe.rs` `HostLayer::experts_into`에 `fits` 검사가 없다(S). 문서 다섯 곳이 `EXPERTS_INTO_MAX`를 아직 현재형으로 쓴다(S).
- 빠진 스택: aa `lintexpect`(54파일, `allow` → `expect` + R16 reason)는 unfor·hostab과 겹쳐 열차 4 끝에서 새로 돈다. e1 `serverobust`는 처음 판이 열차 3 `session`의 "엔진이 위치 거울을 두지 않는다" 규칙과 어긋나 e1이 그 규칙대로 다시 얹었고, 이 열차에 탔다.

### 열차 3이 남긴 것 (09-27 저녁, `session` `605def7` · `launchlog` `38c7e84` · `q5kexp` `7f14cab` · `glm5next` `8965c95` · `glmserve` `09acc76` — aa 한 곳 착륙의 첫 열차)

- 묶음: 110항목(`just affected`가 고른 100/100 + 정적 7 + ptx-scan 3) 중 109 녹색, wall 3,067 s, lint 48. ptx-scan은 base `b05eaee`에 `kq_gate_up_act_q5k`·`q5k_gemv_sel` 두 행만 더해졌고(generate_ds41 149 → 151, gate_e2e·gate_qwen3moe_e2e 94 → 96) 나머지 행·md5는 같다. 빨강 하나는 gate-r8 `a_leftover_part_is_removed_and_a_live_one_is_not`이었다: libtest 병렬 테스트의 spawn이 fork와 exec 사이에 `.part` 잠금의 열린 파일 기술을 쥔다. 단독 3/3 녹색이고, 수정(LOCK_UN)은 03 `r8types`가 열차 4로 가져온다.
- session 커밋은 이동 이상이다: eager + 드래프트는 두 번째 헤드를 첫 타이밍 패스에서 만든다(`--warm` 기본 0), graph + 드래프트는 더미 쌍 패스를 돌지 않는다. 그 HEAD의 첫 시팅(e1 창 2)이 `time step`·`time pass`·SMOKE 줄의 구조를 열차 3 전 로그와 비교한다.
- 리뷰 `cr3`(23건, 보고 원문은 리드 스크래치)의 처분: runtime의 패스 안 EOG·verify 폭을 모르는 ctx 검사·드래프트 리셋 계약과 coverage 사본·스템 표 두 벌은 aa `fix3`(열차 4). app·`generate_ds41`의 여덟(④ eager 워밍, ⑧ `keepable`·`tap_width`가 오류를 0으로, ⑯ `Session.ctx` 중복 — oneload의 `from_model(model, ctx)`까지, ⑰ 노드 수 재계산, ⑱ `OpenLog` 순서 검사, ⑲ 빈 프롬프트가 토큰 0, ⑳ `skip_to`의 `as u32`, ㉒ 호출자 없는 API와 `logits` Vec 재할당)은 oneload 뒤 aa 픽스업(열차 5). kquant의 셋(act 절의 오라클이 커널 자신의 `swiglu_clamp` — `qdot::swiglu_clamp`로, `act::apply`가 모르는 코드를 silu로 처리 — fault로, `expf_ik` 사본 셋)은 `ffnq8act`가 박스 슬롯에서. serve의 도구 형식 추측(모르는 템플릿을 DSML로)은 aa `servetpl`이 `Unparsed` + 501로 닫았다(열차 4). Walk A와 cores의 겹침(⑦, M)과 Q5_K 고정 런처(⑮)는 opslib 몫.

### 03 착륙 묶음 5 (09-27, `q35attn` `4340bef`, `q35moe` `d47064c`·`ea9b603`, `q35lanes` `5f90fff`, `q3gates` `b3a4c68`)

- **착륙 기록.** 네 라운드를 aa의 열차 2와 e1의 도구 셋(`a0e6210`) 위에 한 줄로 쌓아 한 묶음으로 돌렸다. `q35moe`의 슬롯 상한이 `gemm_route`의 md5를 움직여 어차피 전체 목록이라 나머지 둘도 같이 실었다. 묶음 A는 94항목 중 93이 rc 0이고 wall은 2,120 s다(예측 2,484 s[유도]). 빨강 하나는 `check-levers`인데, e1의 relrunner2가 `BLOOMERY_AB_ORDER`를 레지스트리에 넣지 않은 base의 빨강이었다(main 트리에서도 같은 18건). 03이 먼저 착륙하고 e1이 그 위에 행을 넣는 순서로 가서 묶음을 다시 돌지 않았다(`4ad70ca`에서 녹색). V4.1 적재 셋은 묶음 B로 3/3, lint는 48이다.
  - `q35attn`: Qwen3.6 전체 어텐션 층의 카드 커널 — 헤드 256의 q/k 노름과 부분 NEOX 로프, 디코드 플래시(256, 8)와 프리필 플래시 256, 출력 게이트를 접은 q8_1 양자화. 새 (256, 8) 본체는 const-제네릭(`<HEAD, QW>`)이고 기존 Qwen3 엔트리는 그대로다(kernelshape M2 탐침: 128 본체를 옮기면 md5가 움직인다).
  - `q35moe`: 257행 게이트 라우터(256 전문가 + 공유 전문가를 아홉째 슬롯으로, 가중치 sigmoid, 재정규화 없음), F32 결합 스택, 슬롯 상한 36,864(4,096토큰 ubatch × 9)와 Qwen3 `UBATCH` 4,096 고정. ik의 합 순서는 `(routed + resid) + shexp`라 비교는 l_out 밴드다.
  - `q35lanes`: GDN 커널이 몸체의 상태 규칙을 받았다 — delta는 `[lanes][n_v][128][128]` 상태의 한 lane을 제자리에서 읽고 쓰고, lane은 디바이스 워드라 그래프 하나가 모든 스텝을 섬긴다. 범위 밖 워드는 새 폴트 `DeltaLane`, lanes > 1은 이름으로 거부. conv는 위치로 색인하는 ring(`pos mod 11`)을 읽어 롤백에 복사가 없고, 위치가 연속이 아니면 `LinearConv`. 디코드 conv 바이트 −16.6 %, 512토큰 호출은 +0.77 %[유도](예측 "같거나 작다"를 넘었다 — ring 쓰기).
  - `q3gates`: Qwen3 게이트를 계약마다 바이너리 하나로 — ubatch 라우터는 router 게이트로, head argmax는 새 `gate_qwen3moe_head`, qknorm은 rope의 한 절, 그룹 GEMM 벤치는 `gate_gemm`으로. e2e는 텐서 코어 플래시로 한 번만 돈다(163–219 s → 81 s). `BLOOMERY_GQA_MMA`는 퇴역했다. 스칼라 재실행이 덮던 것(스칼라 플래시 위의 e2e 절들)은 엔진 경로가 아니라 커밋에 날짜와 함께 적었다.
- **남긴 것**(각각 크기):
  - `q35attn`: 프리필 256의 레지스터가 예측 186–194에서 250으로 빗나갔다. SASS 생존 구간을 읽으면 256 본체의 ldmatrix 주소에 런타임 항 `half_lines`가 u32로 잘린 usize 식 안에 있어, (스텝, 타일)마다 오프셋이 레지스터 하나씩 끌어올려진다(LDSM만 먹는 IMAD 레지스터 60개, 128 본체는 8개). `4·LINE·half_lines`를 루프 앞에서 기준 주소에 한 번 더하면 약 195–200[유도]이다 — 지금은 smem 98 KB가 이미 SM당 1블록이라 0이고, smem을 줄일 때 값이 생긴다(XS). 교환 덧셈의 `if dh == 0 {a+b} else {b+a}`는 IEEE 덧셈이 교환적이라 한 번이면 된다(XS). `RopeRows`의 폭이 HEAD 고정(`scratch.rs:149`) — q35body가 n_rot 폭을 준다. 게이트 양자화를 `expf_ik` 시그모이드로 비트 일치(S), `Q8Act` 읽기 접근자(XS).
  - `q35moe`: `gate_gemm.rs`의 route 표에 ("qwen35", 257, 9) 없음(S), `elem.rs:306-309` 문서가 FMA 없다고 하나 PTX는 `fma.rn`(XS), `route_core.rs:57`·`experts.rs:4` 문서 낡음(XS), `RouterOut` 호스트 사본 둘(S), `gate-batch.sh`의 락 대기가 시간 중앙값에 섞이던 것은 e1의 `a0e6210`이 닫았다.
  - `q35lanes`: m > 8 호출은 ring 마지막 3행만 써도 된다(XS, 불변식이 둘로 갈림), delta 레지스터 +10의 출처를 prefetch 레버 전에 SASS로(S), fault `Display`가 cause를 두 번 찍는다(XS), `expf_ik` 중복(XS). lanes > 1의 토큰별 저장은 층·토큰당 2 MiB, m = 5 verify 30층이면 +0.37 ms[유도].
  - **조용한 0개 절**(aa의 round 테스트 호스트 실측, 09-27): `gate-qwen35moe-meta`의 앞절 `--lib -- arch::qwen35moe`는 `arch/qwen35moe`에 `#[test]`가 하나도 없어 테스트 0개를 돌고 녹색이다. 절은 지운다(XS). 부류를 닫는 자리는 `tools/gate.sh`다: 이름 필터를 준 호출이 통과 테스트 0개로 끝나면 이름 붙은 실패로 바꾼다(S — gate.sh는 모든 CPU 게이트의 키에 들어가니 다음 착륙 묶음에 싣는다). 같은 모양의 다른 절이 있는지는 그 가드가 첫 묶음에서 보여 준다.
  - `q3gates`: "ubatch 뒤 1–8토큰 꼬리 pass"를 한 토큰 경로와 (u) 밴드로 비교하는 절이 원래 없다 — (u) 프롬프트 하나를 ubatch 512, n = 1025로(S). `gate_gemm`의 `mod bench`와 `gate_p8`의 약 80줄 중복(S), rope 두 절이 `AttnRows`를 두 번 읽음(S), `GEMM_SPREAD_RATIO` PIN 문서의 "scalar arm"(XS, PIN이라 날짜 줄로).

### 03 착륙 묶음 4 (09-27, `q3input` `8bfaa81`, `q35oracle` `a55dd10`, `q35gdn` `f1e2b56`, `r8fix` `e927f1e`)

- **착륙 기록.** 네 커밋을 del2(`e28c7e2`) 위로 리베이스해 한 묶음으로 돌렸다. 묶음 A는 95항목이 모두 rc 0이고 wall은 3,810 s다(예측 3,070 s[유도], 1.24배 — aa의 두 라운드가 트랙 디렉터리에서 빌드했고 `stage-gpu-load-v41`이 rc 75를 아홉 번 재시도했다). lint는 48이다. V4.1을 적재하는 lane-B 셋(`gate-gpu-ds41-chain-ffn`, `gate-ds41-host`, `gate-ds41-kld`)은 두 레인 적재 겹침을 피해 묶음 B로 한 레인에서 돌렸다: 3항목 모두 rc 0, wall 26 s(chain-ffn 121 checks 0 failed, ds41-host r8=on 40층 PASS).
  - `q3input`: 세 경로(decode, P ≤ 8 pass, ubatch)가 입력 `ids + pos0` 하나를 쓰고, embedding 런치가 행마다 위치와 live key 수를 쓴다. rope는 몸체가 적재 때 만든 ctx × 128 표를 위치로 읽는다. dump 60개의 md5가 base와 같고 노드 핀 604/601/673 그대로다. PTX는 `embed_rows_q4k`와 `head_norm_neox_append`(regs 30 → 27)만 움직였다. 예측 효과 +0.02…+0.14 %[유도]는 잣대 안이라 timed A/B는 없다. `stat prompt`의 `copy_us`는 이제 enqueue만 재므로 옛 행과 같은 표에 두지 않는다.
  - `q35oracle`: qwen35moe refset 족과 모델 프로필, `dump-ref-qwen35moe` 레시피. 세 세트(배치, step4 every-node, d1k)가 박스에 있고 `gate-refset`이 16세트 녹색이다. 공유 `dump_ref`를 트리 소스로 다시 지었다(낡은 소스로 `[stale-binary]` 거부 중이었다). 서베이의 열린 질문 셋: Q1 ik의 클램프는 발동하지 않는다(최대 |S| 27.7, 모든 `ssm_a` < 0이라 g ≤ 0), Q3 `new_state`는 ik가 넘기는 상태다(30/30층 비트), Q5 텍스트 IMROPE는 64차원 NEOX와 같다(어텐션 10층 max|diff| 0). 덤프 wall은 58 s로 예측 1.5–2.8분보다 짧았다(틀린 항은 고정비, 카드에 적었다). 층 37에서 exp(g)가 f32 0으로 떨어지는 자리가 있다(스텝 세트당 960 중 1) — 근사 exp 커널은 거기서 비트가 갈린다.
  - `q35gdn`: Gated DeltaNet 카드 커널 셋(conv+준비, delta 스텝, 게이트 노름), 각각 호스트 규칙과 비트 동일, 512토큰 prefill = 1토큰 호출 512번. 상태는 `[n_v][v][k]`(mainline·mistral.rs 배치). 증명은 aa가 제안한 **add 급**의 첫 사례다: 기존 행과 md5가 그대로이고 새 행만 더해졌다. 디코드 층당 4.69 MB, 6.7 µs, 512 ubatch의 GDN 재귀 30층 합 4.3–6.0 ms[유도] — 옛 22 ms는 mainline 커널의 실측이었다. 원장 31은 이 라운드가 찾았다.
  - `r8fix`: r8 사이드카가 자기를 검사한 원본의 입력을 들고 다니고, split 옆에서 읽는 모든 곳이 먼저 짝을 확인한다(다른 모델의 split과 짝지으면 이름 붙은 거부). r8을 덮는 게이트는 사이드카가 없으면 거부한다(`BLOOMERY_R8=off`는 원본으로). 리뷰의 작은 항목 열둘. chain-ffn 게이트 네 줄은 aa가 승인했다. 적재 두 스테이지가 새 `populate:`/`lock:` 줄과 (파일, run) 비교로 녹색이다.
- **남긴 것**(각각 크기):
  - `q3input`: `crates/gpu-deepseek41/src/draft/stage.rs:82–141`의 `Inbox`와 qwen3moe `scratch.rs`의 `Inbox`가 같은 타입이다 — 공통 코어를 `crates/gpu`로(S, `lib.rs`는 aa). V2-Lite refresh(`arch/deepseek2/mod.rs:306,315`)가 스텝마다 `Vec`을 할당하고 sync 복사한다(M). `param_view` 창의 SAFETY 불변식 여섯 사본 → 수명 있는 `View<'a>`(R2, S–M). `model.rs:750–756` `step` 문서(XS, aa).
  - `q35oracle`: `build-ref-dump`가 기본 프로필(deepseek2)로 지어 다른 프로필에 `[foreign-lib]` 함정(한 줄), `dump_ref --list-nodes` 없음(S–M), qwen3moe 노드 덤프에 refset 족 없음(S), ik 스칼라 경로가 NaN 상태를 −1e6으로, NaN g를 50으로 바꾼다(ik 쪽, 업스트림 후보). Q3 전용 세트 `u1s4`/`u1s5`(3 GB)는 q35body 뒤에 지운다.
  - `q35gdn`: `expf_ik` 중복(`gpu-deepseek41/src/experts.rs:54`, XS), delta prefetch 레버(`linear/delta.rs:213`, 토큰당 ~700 → ~504 사이클[유도], M), 디코드 전용 norm_gate 융합(S–M), fault `Display`가 cause를 두 번 찍는다(XS). softplus는 ik와 맞추려고 ggml 모양으로 뒀다(log1p가 더 정확하다).
  - `r8fix`: `experts_into`/`stacks_of`/`populate`/`resident`/`HostLock::lock`이 호출마다 `&Split`을 받아 짝이 호출의 split까지 묶지 못한다(F2 부류, S), 적재 게이트 `evict`가 해제 뒤 짝 확인 창을 다시 부른다(XS), `drop_pages`의 호출자 계약 → `FileMapping` newtype(R28, S), 짝 거부가 `PlacementError::Host(String)`에 문자열로 싸여 있다(S, `placement.rs`·`lib.rs`).

### 재구성 열차 2가 남긴 것 (09-27 오후, `gpumodel` `ed9c368` · `modelspec` `2a35555` · `levers2` `6abaa16` — 한 묶음으로 착륙)

- **착륙 기록.** 셋을 한 스택으로 리베이스해(gpumodel → modelspec → levers2) 묶음 한 번으로 착륙했다(`plan.md` 「함대」 규칙 13). 묶음: `total=104 red=0 wall=1877 s lint_warnings=48 on 82fbcc2; the first batch on the same list was red on two items (the levers2 record test, fixed; gate-gpu-ds41-faults at one step's minflt, green on the rerun)`. 셋 다 이동이다 — gpumodel은 ptx-scan 세 bin(generate_ds41·gate_e2e·gate_qwen3moe_e2e)이 행·md5까지 base와 같고 노드 핀(1169/2338, 1172/2344, 648, 604, 601/673)이 그대로다; modelspec은 ptx-scan 셋 동일에 GPU 게이트 일곱과 dspark-loop의 verdict가 base와 같다; levers2는 자기 base(cdd90f3)에서 ptx-scan 동일·verdict 동일(이름 붙은 새 거절만 다름)이다. 이름 붙은 동작 변경은 커밋 메시지에 하나씩 적었다(V4-Flash 거절 목록의 인스턴스 항목 셋, 창 전용 층 인덱스 거절, qwen35moe 파일의 커버리지 거절; 미지 `BLOOMERY_*` 이름·바이너리가 안 쓰는 레버·`+2`/`02`·목록 밖 record kind의 거절). 커버리지 변경 하나: `gate-ds41-load` (iv)의 seed 절이 빠졌다 — V4.1 `Body`에 `seed_depth`가 없어(`Instrumented`는 V2-Lite·Qwen3만) 그 거절이 컴파일 오류가 됐다(09-27, 커밋 메시지에 사유).
- **리드가 리베이스에서 합친 것.** `crates/gpu-gates/src/engine.rs`: modelspec의 spec 디스패치(커버리지 검사 뒤 `read.spec.arch`로 분기) 위에 gpumodel의 생성자(`Deepseek2Model::open`, `Qwen3moeModel::open(Gpu::new()?, file, lever_opts(ctx)?)`). levers2의 레지스트리에 del2의 은퇴 행 셋을 다시 얹고 `DECISION_4` 상수를 뺐으며, del2의 이름별 거절 시험 둘은 levers2의 일반 시험(`retired_names_are_refused_whatever_their_value`, 은퇴 행 전부)이 덮어 싣지 않았다. 리드 행: `BLOOMERY_BOX_CARD`(러너; 이 행이 없으면 `at_main` 바이너리 전부가 거절한다 — levers2 보고의 예측대로), `BLOOMERY_GATE_ROUND_LEDGER`(e1 `437eb2e`의 경로), `BLOOMERY_R8`(main 것을 복사; r8land가 levers2의 base 뒤에 착륙), `ds41_meta.rs`의 `BLOOMERY_DSPARK_MODEL` 읽기를 direct 목록에; 기준 뒤 착륙한 코드와 맞춘 것 — 러너 행 `BLOOMERY_GEN_PLACE`·`BLOOMERY_PREHEAT`(`ref/depth-ds41.sh`), direct 목록에 `ds41_host.rs`의 R8 읽기(03 승인, `r8_lever()`가 hybrid.rs와 같은 제자리 on/off 읽기)와 soak의 `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `soak_ds41_serve`의 `at_main`에 서버와 같은 `ACTS_ON`, levers2의 record 시험에 r8fix의 `sidecar_bytes`(첫 묶음이 여기서 빨강); `BLOOMERY_CPU_RUST` 행 삭제(주인 `cpu-measure.sh`가 del2로 갔다). AGENTS: Commands에 `gate-qwen35moe-meta`, 변경 클래스 표에 **"add" 행**(새 커널 계열·엔트리: ptx-scan = base + 새 행만, gate-ptx-spill이 그 행에서만 빨강→핀→녹색, 계열 게이트 절마다 FAIL-first, 시간 A/B 없음; 첫 적용 `q5kexp`). `undocumented_unsafe_blocks`를 `deny`로(del2 뒤 0/48; MUL-11의 래칫은 닫힘 — 이슈는 리드가 닫는다).
- **03 파일의 훙크(03 승인 09-27).** gpumodel: `arch/qwen3moe/body.rs`(`OpenOpts`, `FlashKind::from_mma`, `impl GpuModel<Body> { open, lever_opts }`), `mod.rs` 한 줄, `hybrid.rs`의 replay-watch 배관 제거(del2가 런치 스레드를 지웠으니 죽은 배관). modelspec: `arch/qwen3moe/spec.rs` 신규 + `mod.rs` 한 줄. 03 주의: q3input(`99c0d39`)이 같은 body.rs를 크게 바꿨으므로(`RopeRows`, `Prefill::new(stream, dims)`, `resident_bytes`에 Inbox·RopeRows) 리베이스 뒤 e2e의 resident_bytes가 q3input 기록값과 같아야 한다 — 착륙 묶음의 `gate-gpu-qwen3moe-e2e`가 그 자리다. q3gates가 `BLOOMERY_GQA_MMA`를 은퇴시키면 `lever_opts`의 flash 읽기는 빠지고 `FlashKind`가 유일한 선택자가 된다.
- **gpumodel이 남긴 것(보고 `specs/wave-r2/reports/gpumodel.md` §5).** `GpuModel::body_parts`/`body`/`stage_stream`은 실패할 수 없는데 `Result`와 `what` 인자를 들고 있다 — 03의 qwen3moe 파일이 부르므로(약 150 호출 자리, S–M) 03의 q35 라운드들 뒤 기계 라운드로. `gate_deepseek41_skew.rs:1036` verdict 문구 `step_pair(...)`(다음 verdict를 건드리는 라운드에서 한 줄). `shared/ds41_dspark.rs:236` `target_ctx`의 실패 못 하는 `Result`(XS; session이 그 파일을 만지므로 session 뒤). `AnyEngine::open`의 Qwen3 팔이 모델을 다 적재한 뒤 호출자 둘(gate_e2e·generate)이 거절한다 — 적재 전에 거절하면 적재 한 번을 아낀다(S). `hybrid.rs` `Hybrid::serve_captured()`(인자 없음)는 호출자가 없다([03], XS). V4.1 `enqueue_pair`/`decode_pair`는 2행 고정이고 `Rows::enqueue_rows`가 `[a, b]`를 푼다 — layerprog R3 `rowsm`이 넓힌다.
- **modelspec이 남긴 것(보고 `specs/wave-r2/reports/modelspec.md` §5).** `crates/tokenizer/src/pretok.rs:211` `Pre::NAMES`가 `pub(crate)`라 `coverage::PRE_TOKENIZERS`가 사본을 든다 — pub으로 열고 시험으로 대조(XS). `arch/qwen3moe/body.rs:130-155` `pins()`의 hidden ≤ NORM_K·256 배수 검사가 커버리지 검사에 없다([03], S — q35body가 `LayerSpec`만 읽게 될 때 함께). `crates/serve`: Qwen3 spec이 오늘 동작대로 `tools: Some(Dsml)`로 기록되는데 틀린 값이다(S, serve 템플릿 라운드로). 설계 메모 §3·§6의 낡은 문장 둘은 이 커밋에서 날짜 주석으로 고쳤다.
- **machineaxes가 남긴 것(메모 `docs/research/machine-axes.md` §6, 처분 M1–M5).** `isarefuse`(S, 공개 전, fixup7과 함께 — 모든 bin의 `main` 첫 줄): `qdot/src/lib.rs:170-172,241`의 런타임 ISA 검사가 znver3 빌드에서 상수 참이라 폴백·거절이 죽은 코드(AVX2 없는 CPU에서 SIGILL); `ops.rs:3571`이 ISA 부족을 `UnsupportedType`으로 부른다 — ISA 변형으로. `archkey`(S, 도구, Qwen3.6 사슬 뒤): `tools/check-rustflags.sh:24`의 `znver3` 하드코딩, `tools/ptx-scan.sh:221-236`의 `blocks()` sm_86 상수(ARCH를 바꾸면 blk/SM 열이 틀림)와 `:192-194`의 "둘 다 GA102", `tools/gate.sh:24`의 둘째 `--arch sm_86` 주인, `gate_p8.rs:1030`의 82 SM 리터럴(`multiprocessor_count`로), `ptx-shapes.tsv`의 `*` 행 + arch 예외 행. XS 문서: `tools/flow/constants.tsv:8`의 `n_sm`은 "measured"가 아니라 사양이다. 보류(M): `threads/src/lib.rs:387-393`의 동일 코어 분배는 이종 코어 기계(GB10의 X925/A725)에서 가중이 필요하다.
- **levers2가 남긴 것(보고 `specs/wave-r2/reports/levers2.md` §5).** [03]으로 둘: `crates/model/tests/r8file.rs:564`의 1/4 플레이크 `R8(Busy)` — 가설은 `live.try_lock()`을 쥔 채 같은 프로세스의 CLI 시험이 `r8conv`를 spawn하면 fork–exec 사이 자식이 같은 open file description을 물어 `drop(live)` 뒤에도 잠금이 남는다는 것(해법: 잠금을 자식에서 잡기, S); `hybrid.rs:208` `fn flag`와 `ops.rs:2727` `parse_steal`이 값을 trim하는데 행은 `Kind::Flag`(trim 없음)라 문서와 동작이 다르다(XS). 도구(e1, S): `tools/recipes.py:553` `_LITERAL`이 레지스트리의 문서용 경로 리터럴을 입력으로 잡는다(`bench_v41_host.rs`·`bloomery-decode.rs`·`ds41_dspark.rs`가 각 87개 레시피) — `registry.rs`를 리터럴 스캔에서 뺀다. aa 픽스업 묶음(`fixup7`, M, 열차 3 뒤 — session·launchlog가 같은 파일을 만진다): `glue.rs:1104` `STEP_STATS`가 engram 통계 수집도 켠다(prefill 게이트는 split 줄만 찍는다, S); `body.rs:144` `OpenCfg::from_levers`가 `PREFILL=steps`에서 효과 없는 CED·GROUP을 받아들인다 — 이름으로 거절(S, 조용한 실패 부류); `body.rs:165` `BodyMeta` 공개 필드 문서(XS); `gate_deepseek41_step.rs:717,726`·`skew.rs:346,355`의 `st.ratio as usize`(XS); 위 gpumodel의 XS 셋도 같은 묶음. 받아들임(스펙대로): `at_main`이 pool을 안 만드는 바이너리에서도 THREADS·SPIN을 받는다(S, 다음 레버 라운드가 acts_on에 pool 여부를 더하면 닫힌다). 이미 맞음: `docs/gates-plan.md:98`의 `BLOOMERY_GATE_LEDGER=1`은 선이 그어져 있고 정정 문장이 뒤따른다.

### 재구성 파동 2가 남긴 것 (09-27, `levers` `64aaab8`, `records` `8fc1832`·`d2e42d3`, `refset` `30b25fc`, `toolsw2` `c2bea7b`)

- **착륙 기록.** `levers`는 호스트 전용 이동이다. 두 ptx-scan 표(generate_ds41, gate_e2e)가 행과 md5까지 베이스와 같다(라운드가 보이고 리드가 다시 스캔했다: `generate_ds41` 284줄과 `gate_e2e` 174줄이 `cmp`로 같다). 번들 바이트만 움직였다(nvlabs-ledger §11 부류: `bloomery-gpu` 2,507,392 → 2,507,363 B, `bloomery-gpu-deepseek41` 1,567,413 → 1,567,435 B). 리드 묶음 34항목이 모두 rc 0이고 wall은 1,729 s다. 예측은 1,781 s였다[유도]. 러너가 찍은 1,609 s는 기록이 없는 `stage-gpu-load-v41`에 기본값 45 s를 넣은 값이다(실제 162 s). lint는 133 그대로다. 돌린 것은 정적 검사 여덟과 ptx-spill·levers, 풀을 짓는 게이트(threads·ds41-host·hybrid·e2e·qwen3moe-e2e·gates-lib), 배치 계획(placement·qwen3moe-placement·ds41-plan), V4.1을 여는 게이트(ds41-lib·step·prefill 기본 팔과 `PREFILL_GROUP=1` 팔(P = 512만)·long·faults·skew·dspark-loop·ds41-load·chain-glue·ds41-engram·draft·ds41-serve·chat), `stage-gpu-load-v41`(계획 b)이다. 뺀 것은 넷이다. 커널만 도는 게이트는 PTX가 같다. V2-Lite CPU 게이트는 바뀐 경로가 풀을 짓는 한 곳뿐이고, 그 경로는 threads·ds41-host가 본다. prefill-q3ksplit은 `main`의 파싱만 바뀌었고 Q3K_SPLIT를 읽는 자리는 그대로다. `stage-gpu-load-v41-lock`은 같은 바이너리에 `HOST_LOCK=1`만 켠 팔이다. 잠금 경로(`gpu/hybrid.rs`)는 바뀌지 않았고, 넣으면 묶음이 30분을 넘는다[유도]. 이것은 다음 착륙 묶음에 넣는다. `CED=off` 팔은 설계상 빨강이다(게이트가 삼각형 켜짐을 고정한다). 라운드 묶음에서 그 팔의 판정 줄은 베이스와 같았다. 베이스 로그가 있는 게이트 열둘(prefill·step·e2e·hybrid·qwen3moe-e2e·placement·threads·ds41-lib·gates-lib·ds41-plan·draft·ds41-engram)은 `verdict-diff`로 모두 같고, `PREFILL_GROUP=1` 팔은 P = 512 케이스 줄이 베이스 팔의 그 줄과 같다(`group=1`, 배치 버퍼 457,177,792 B).
- **AGENTS의 레버 산문은 레지스트리로 갔다.** 116줄이 `crates/levers/src/registry.rs`를 가리키는 한 문단이 됐다. 표는 `just gate-levers`가 찍는다. 옛 산문의 원문은 행마다 인용하던 측정값과 함께 `382bde6`의 AGENTS.md 566–681행에 있다.
- **조용한 실패 둘(다음 레버 라운드, S).** 오타 난 `BLOOMERY_*` 이름(`BLOOMERY_PREFIL=steps`)이 아무 말 없이 통과한다. 레지스트리에 없는 이름을 거절하려면 러너·경로 변수(`BLOOMERY_BOX_ENV`, `BLOOMERY_REMOTE`, `BLOOMERY_DATA` 등)도 행이 있어야 한다. 은퇴 이름 거절도 `at_main`을 부르는 bin 12개에만 닿는다. gate_e2e와 V2-Lite·Qwen3 GPU bin, CPU 게이트, bloomery-decode, bench_v41_host는 `CARD_EXPERTS`·`STEP_PAIR`를 여전히 조용히 무시한다.
- **값을 삼키는 읽기(XS씩).** `model/src/ops.rs:150`(POISON)과 `:2284`(DEFER_QUANT)는 "0"이 아니면 전부 켬으로 읽는다([03] 소유라 03에 넘긴다). `model/src/profile.rs:84-86`은 쓰레기 값을 0으로, 7을 2로 바꾼다(v2fence). `gpu/src/flash_gqa.rs:108-109`, `flash.rs:250-251`, `lib.rs:264-265, 271-272`의 `Err(_) =>`는 UTF-8이 아닌 값을 기본값으로 삼킨다. `flash.rs:244`의 FLASH_MMA 거절도 그 값은 놓친다.
- **레버 도구(XS).** 값이 잘못되면 `--levers`가 표 대신 오류를 찍는다. Direct 행은 설정돼 있어도 `-`로 나온다(`set <raw> (read in place)`가 디버깅에 낫다). `check-levers`는 "목록은 줄기만 한다"를 강제하지 않는다. 베이스의 목록과 대조하면 된다.
- **은퇴 이름을 부르는 카드·도구(XS).** `docs/cards/cardtile-pp.card:2, 21`, `docs/cards/prose-cardin.card:10`(두 카드는 09-30 삭제), `tools/flow/ds41_prefill.py:1699, 2471`이 `CARD_EXPERTS`를 부른다. 그 카드를 다시 돌리면 이름으로 거절된다. `tools/ref/timing-card.sh:32`와 `depth-ds41.sh:458`은 `BLOOMERY_DRAFT`를 문자열로 비교하는 두 번째 파서다.
- **2파동 `gpumodel`으로.** `gpu/src/model.rs:61-65`의 `type Meta` 문서는 아직 "deepseek41's hyperparameters"라고 한다(이제 `BodyMeta{hp, levers}`). FLASH_SEG를 경로 인자로 옮기려면 `ChainBody::load`와 V2-Lite의 `seg_keys` 호출자(`arch/deepseek2/{dispatch,scratch}.rs`)를 함께 고쳐야 한다(v2fence와 같이).
- **3파동 `session`으로.** `BLOOMERY_DSPARK_CARD`(`gpu-gates/src/bin/shared/ds41_dspark.rs:74`)는 레지스트리 행이 없고 허용 목록에만 있다. `generate_ds41`은 계획을 두 번 짠다(`print_plan`과 `body::open`; 적재 때의 호스트 산술이다).
- **이번에 고쳤다.** `tools/recipes.py`의 `ALWAYS`와 `gate-batch.sh`의 스모크 목록에 `check-levers`를 넣었다. `verdict-diff.py`에 잡음 마스크를 더했다: 층-배치 시간 `*_lb`, `ms=`, `tok/s…=`, engram의 warm/cold 분할, just가 찍는 레시피 줄 번호. 지속 시간 마스크는 이제 `n=512 ms=`의 `512 ms`를 먹지 않는다. B 파일이 없으면 트레이스백 대신 이름 붙은 오류로 끝난다.
- **candmask가 더 본 것(XS씩).** `docs/research/v41-ops-report.md:91-93`의 "layers > 20" → 24·28·32·36(나머지는 목록을 재사용). 마스크가 착륙하면 `docs/v41-placement.md:120`의 1M 깊이 약 9 ms/토큰을 약 3.5 ms로[유도]. 후보 설정이 GGUF에 없다 → skel의 키 이름으로 변환기 PR(S, 업스트림). 후보 수 < top_k면 소비자가 −inf 행을 본다 → `with_candidates`가 이름으로 거절(R1). prompt batch의 점수 패스가 토큰마다 index key를 다 읽는다(`indexer.rs:297`; 32k 깊이 512위치 배치에 약 27.9 GB[유도]) → 청크 8토큰이 키 타일을 나누면 약 8배 준다(M, 긴 프롬프트의 배치 폭 레버). top-k 패스가 토큰당 블록 하나라 16k–32k 행에서 SM 84개 중 하나만 쓴다(`indexer.rs:597`; exllamav3의 나눠 합치기로 32k에서 스텝당 약 30–60 µs[유도], 잣대 아래라 ctx_max가 1M 쪽으로 갈 때만).
- 버림: `body.rs`의 `hp: inputs.hp.clone()`(적재 때 한 번).
- **leversreview가 찾은 것 → 라운드 `levers2`(S–M, `records` 착륙 뒤: 둘 다 바이너리의 `main`을 고친다).** 보고는 세션 밖 사본 `specs/wave-r2/reports/leversreview.md`에 있다. 맨 앞은 조용한 실패다. 바이너리 열두 개가 모든 Parsed 레버를 파싱하지만, 그 값을 쓰는 레버는 바이너리마다 다르다. 그래서 `BLOOMERY_PREFILL=steps just gate-gpu-ds41-prefill`, 스텝만 도는 바이너리의 `CED=off`, 열한 바이너리의 `DRAFT=lookup`이 아무 말 없이 무시되고, `--levers`는 그 값을 `set`으로 찍는다. CARD_EXPERTS를 거부하게 만든 실패와 같은 모양이다. 고침은 `at_main(acts_on)`이다. 바이너리가 쓰는 레버를 이름으로 대고, 목록 밖에서 설정된 레버는 이름으로 거부한다. 같은 라운드가 가져갈 것: 오타 난 `BLOOMERY_*` 이름 거부(위), `tests.rs`를 레지스트리를 도는 표 구동 시험 하나로(한 계약을 네 번 박고, 지운 식을 단언하는 `fail_first`, 산문이 사라진 뒤의 `prose_names_are_rows`), `from_env_named` → `PoolLevers`(부분 읽기가 전체 `Levers` 타입이라 다른 접근자가 패닉한다), `parse_bytes`의 `String` 오류 → 열거형(넘침 이유가 버려진다), 그룹 상한 8의 주인 셋(`registry.rs`, `GROUP_MAX`, 메시지) → 하나, `pub use registry::*`로 넓은 공개 표면, 공개 필드 문서, `card_budget` → `card_budget_bytes`, `check-levers`가 `tests/`와 `build.rs`도 훑게(42곳, 목록에 하네스 묶음 약 20줄), 이름을 인자로 받는 도우미(`ops.rs` `lever_var`, `hybrid.rs` `flag`)에 새 이름을 넘기면 통과하는 사각, 제자리 읽기 줄의 값 삼키기 모양(`.ok()`, `Err(_)` …)에 표지를 요구해 래칫. **[03]·v2fence 전환 때 정할 것:** Direct 행의 Kind는 아무도 검사하지 않는 문서다. 제자리 코드는 trim하거나 느슨하다(STEAL, ATTN_BUNDLE·HALVES, HYBRID_OVERLAP·HOST_*·CARD_DONTNEED, LAUNCH_THREAD). 전환하는 순간 오늘 먹히는 `" 1"` 같은 값이 거부되기 시작하므로, 행마다 조일지 trim을 둘지를 전환 스펙이 정한다. **흩어진 조용한 경로(XS씩, 주인별):** `attn.rs:1088, 1108`의 FLASH_SIMD·KV_PREFETCH는 `== "0"`만 봐서 `off`·`false`가 조용히 켜짐(v2fence); `bloomery-decode.rs:132-136` WEIGHTS 오타가 mapped로, `:122, :129`와 `bench_v41_host.rs:3415`의 PIN_MAIN·POPULATE가 "0" 아니면 켬(v2fence/[03]); `THREADS`가 cpu 수를 넘으면 조용히 슬롯을 나눠 씀(`threads/src/lib.rs` `cpu_for`); `attn.rs:2491-2495` ATTN_HALVES=2가 latent가 16의 배수가 아니면 조용히 1; `gate_deepseek41_chain_attn.rs:165, 181` UTF-8 아닌 MUTATE가 "변이 없음"으로 읽혀 FAIL-first 도구가 초록; UTF-8 아닌 값·빈 값을 unset으로 읽는 곳 여럿(`gguf/src/v41.rs:40-43`, `gpu-gates/src/lib.rs:107-108, 1112, 1115` 등). **그 밖:** chat은 프롬프트를 늘 스텝으로 먹인다(`generate.rs` → `GpuModel::step`; serve와 generate_ds41은 배치) → 3파동 `session`의 chat 배치 프리필(M). `serve/src/api.rs:660`의 `env!("BLOOMERY_SERVE_COMMIT")`는 레지스트리 밖 컴파일 시점 읽기. levers 착륙 기록의 "이동"에 한 줄: 잘못된 입력의 계약은 바뀌었다(이제 거부).
- **시팅 10이 남긴 것(sit10plan 보고, 2파동 `refset`이 대부분 가져감).** `tools/ref/dump-draft.sh`의 `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps`는 카드를 지정하지 않는다. NVML은 `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`를 무시하므로, A6000의 프로세스 하나가 3090 덤프를 rc 75로 막는다(XS, `-i`). 또 이 스크립트는 3090 게이트 락의 두 번째 주인이다(`gpu-gate.sh` 밖의 raw `flock`). 그 락을 쥔 채 임대를 최대 30분 기다린다(S). `router/` 트레이스와 384개 빈도 목록 파일은 혼합 파일과 #2507 이전 ik에서 떴다. 모든 타이밍 시팅이 쓰는 목록인데, 공개 파일에서 순위를 다시 유도한 적이 없다(M, 아래 refset 절로 옮김).
- **착륙 기록 (`records` `8fc1832`·`d2e42d3`).** 호스트 전용 이동이다. 레코드 줄의 텍스트는 바이트 단위로 같고(이름을 바꾼 필드 0개), 새로 생긴 줄은 `call …`(배치 실행이면 적재 앞)과 STEP_STATS 아래의 `stat prefill front`·`stat prefill lb`뿐이다. 라운드가 보인 증명은 ptx-scan 두 표 동일, 소유 게이트 여섯(prefill·step·draft·chat·dspark-loop·serve)의 판정 줄 동일(serve는 pid·버전·포트만 다르다), gates-lib 46 통과, lint 133, 계획 검사의 FAIL-first다. 리드 묶음은 25항목 가운데 24개가 rc 0이다. 빨강 하나는 리드가 잘못 쓴 `ptx-scan` 항목이다(아래). wall은 1,999 s로 30분을 넘었다. 러너의 예측은 1,375 s[유도]였고, 30분 안이라 승인 없이 걸었다. 빠진 항은 V4.1 크레이트를 바꾼 뒤 첫 V4.1 게이트가 치르는 재빌드다(step 264 s, 중앙값 42 s). prefill·draft·serve도 중앙값보다 느렸다. 러너는 최근 다섯 행의 중앙값만 쓰므로 크레이트 재빌드를 모른다(도구 항목, 아래). lint는 133 그대로다. 베이스 로그(`d02d4e6`의 levers 묶음과 시팅 10 확인 묶음)가 있는 스물하나 가운데 열여덟은 판정 줄이 같다. 다른 셋은 모두 설명된다. gates-lib는 새 레코드 시험 다섯이 늘었다(41 → 46 통과). check-recipes의 카드 시험 203 → 206은 시팅 10이 넣은 카드 셋이다. ptx-spill은 `generate_ds41`의 번들 바이트만 4,095,648 → 4,095,632 B(−16 B)로 움직였다(행과 md5 동일, nvlabs-ledger §11 부류). 두 ptx-scan 표는 `d02d4e6` 베이스와 행·md5까지 같다(`generate_ds41` 284줄, `gate_e2e` 174줄). 뺀 것은 셋이다. `stage-gpu-load-v41`은 적재 경로 파일(`placement.rs`, `placement/`, `gpu/src/{hybrid,weights}.rs`, `gate_load_v41.rs`)이 `64aaab8` 이후 그대로이고 그때 녹색이었다. STEP_STATS `gen-ds41`에 `--counts`를 무는 확인은 라운드가 P 128·512·4096에서 `counts: equal`을 보였고, 그 뒤 prefill 경로 파일이 바뀌지 않았다(이 확인은 `toolsw2`가 게이트로 만든다). prefill-q3ksplit은 베이스 로그가 없고, 이 팔은 결정 4(09-27 확정)로 지운다. levers 착륙에서 넘어온 `stage-gpu-load-v41-lock`은 이번 묶음에 넣었다: 171 s, rc 0. 계획 (b)의 호스트 세트 190,634,930,176 B를 8샤드에 걸쳐 4.3 s에 mlock했고, VmLck가 그 값과 같아 PASS다.
- **리드 실수 하나(묶음 안, 해 없음).** 묶음 항목을 `ptx-scan:generate_ds41 gpu,deepseek41`로 썼다. 레시피는 피처를 `--features` 옵션으로만 받으므로 둘째 단어가 엔트리 필터로 갔다. cargo는 `generate_ds41`을 `--features gpu`로 지어(더미 main, `.oxart` 없음) 트랙의 바이너리를 덮었고, 스캔은 `section=none`으로 rc 1이었다. 레인 A의 다음 사용자(draft·dspark-loop)는 실행 전에 `--features deepseek41`로 다시 짓는데, cargo는 신선한 유닛도 산출물을 다시 링크하므로 더미를 돈 게이트는 없다. 스캔은 옵션 형태로 다시 돌렸다. 09-25에 이어 두 번째이고 wave 2 공통 계약이 라운드에 경고하던 바로 그 형태다. 부류 봉쇄는 `toolsw2` T9다(피처가 필요한 bin에 `required-features`를 달아 cargo가 짓기 전에 거절하게 한다). 닫음(`c2bea7b`).
- **흐름 모형의 카운트가 한 칸 뒤처져 있었다(`d2e42d3`, 고침).** `eb3e08a`(prefillgroup) 이후 엔진은 카드 타이밍이 켜지면 층-배치마다 표지 넷(셰도의 시작과 끝 포함)을 기록했는데, 모형은 예전 셋을 셌다. `--counts`를 처음 돌리자 드러났다. 백테스트의 PG 행이 마지막 자리에서 움직였다(PG.g2.pp +1.67 → +1.66, PG.g2.wait +6.92 → +6.90). B1·CT 행은 그대로다.
- **records가 남긴 것(보고는 세션 밖 사본 `specs/wave-r2/reports/records.md` 4·5절).**
  - **`levers2`로(XS).** `crates/gpu-gates/src/record.rs`의 `at_main`이 바이너리의 kind 목록을 등록하고 `Record::line`이 소속을 검사하면, "스키마에 없는 kind를 찍는다"는 부류가 닫힌다(약 15줄). 지금은 정적 스캔으로 네 바이너리의 kind와 목록이 양방향으로 같음만 확인했다. levers2가 같은 `main` 첫 줄을 고친다.
  - **3파동 `opslib`로(S–M).** 호출 쪽이 callee의 런치 수를 옆에 적어 센다(`prefill.rs`의 `Tally` 자리 다섯: front·route·engram·shadow·post). `Entries`를 `FfnPiece::enqueue_batch_route/shadow/join`, `FfnBatch::enqueue_download/upload`, `Glue::enqueue_batch_embed/engram`, `AttnChain::enqueue_step_of`까지 넘기면 셈의 주인이 enqueue 자리 하나가 된다(M). `prefill.rs`의 `reads_q8`·`shadow_entries`는 층-배치마다 가중치 이름 String을 만들어 찾는다. open 때 층별 상수로 정할 수 있다(S). 링 규칙 `ctx_max.min(hp.window)`이 `body.rs`의 `load_layer_kv`와 `prefill.rs`의 `BodyLevers::call_plan`(이번에 생김) 두 곳에 있다. 함수 하나로 모은다(XS). 어긋나면 `check_plan`이 이름으로 멈추므로 조용한 실패는 아니다. `body.rs`의 `pub use prefill::{…}`에 `CallPlan`·`PromptCounts`·`LbCount`·`FrontCount`가 없어서, 바이너리가 자체 view(`CallView`)를 만들었다(S).
  - **다음 삭제 묶음으로(XS).** `body/ced.rs`의 `Need::describe`는 부르는 곳이 없다.
  - **[03]으로.** `crates/model/src/moe.rs`가 `load host_tier`를 `eprintln`으로 찍는다. `record.rs` 밖에서 찍히는 유일한 줄이라, `records.py check`가 모든 V4.1 로그에서 rc 1이다. 기록 sink를 받거나 값을 돌려주게 한다(S). Qwen3 쪽 레코드 전환도 남았다: `generate_qwen3moe`의 출력 13곳, `depth-qwen3moe.sh`의 컷 약 5개, `q3pp.py`의 정규식 2개, `nsys-gpu.sh`의 qwen 분기다. 이번 Rust 작업의 절반 크기다(M, 계획과 카운터는 없음).
  - 버림(기록만): `--plan`에는 층-배치별 런치 목록이 없다. 런치 수는 적재된 가중치(양자화 형식이 join 여부와 토큰별·청크별 런치를 가르고, 카드 스택이 셰도 블록을 가른다)가 정하는데, `--plan`은 적재 전에 끝나도록 설계했다. 그 몫은 카운터 레코드와 `--counts`가 한다. prefill 게이트의 P = 512·128 route 평균(506.5·143.6)이 generate_ds41의 값(506.4·143.5)과 다른 원인은 호출 모양 차이로 좁혔고, 확인하지는 않았다(둘 다 베이스와 같다).
- **묶음 예측에 재빌드 항이 없다(도구, S).** `tools/gate-batch.sh`의 예측은 항목마다 최근 다섯 행의 중앙값이라, 크레이트를 바꾼 뒤 그 크레이트의 첫 게이트가 치르는 재빌드를 모른다. records 묶음이 이것으로 1,375 s[유도] 예측에 1,999 s가 걸렸다. `just affected`가 이미 박스의 bin별 dep-info 나이를 읽으므로, 바뀐 크레이트에 닿는 bin의 첫 항목에 그 bin의 빌드 시간(원장 행에서)을 더하면 된다.
- **혼합 파일 삭제(결정 8, refset 착륙 뒤 — `30b25fc`로 착륙, 핀 넷은 `del2` `e28c7e2`의 D4가 뺐다; 남은 것은 파일 삭제와 del2가 남긴 박스 데이터 21개, 조용한 창에 리드가).** 03이 알려 준 대로 파일만 지우면 빨강이 되는 핀이 aa 쪽에 넷 있다: `crates/model/tests/placement.rs`의 `MIXED: FilePins`(gate-placement), `crates/gguf/src/v41.rs`의 `MIXED`와 그 단위 시험(`set_suffix_of(MIXED)`), `gguf-inventory.rs`, `tools/ref/models/deepseek41.sh`의 `V41_MIXED`. 삭제 라운드가 이것을 날짜 붙인 커버리지 사유와 함께 빼서 착륙시킨 다음에 파일을 지운다(혼합 파일 476,991,454,912 B, 혼합 노드 덤프 8,265,740,084 B, ikppl 혼합 7,401,300,256 B, 옮겨 둔 `ikppl/mixed/`·`greedy-ds41/mixed/`·`ref-draft/code64_n32_w3-mixed/`). 박스 매니페스트가 `$BLOOMERY_DATA` 전체를 해시하므로 원장의 녹색 키가 전부 움직인다. 라우터 트레이스(`router/{code,prose,korean,threads,oracle}`)와 384·64개 빈도 목록 파일은 혼합 파일에서 떴다(09-23). 목록은 남으니 그것을 쓰는 카드는 그대로 돌지만, 공개 파일의 라우팅으로 다시 뜨려면 트레이스를 새로 돌려야 한다(V4.1 카드 경로 항목). rig-log 09-23의 트레이스·목록 출처 줄에 혼합 파일임을 적는다.
- **착륙 기록 (`refset` `30b25fc`).** 참조 세트의 판독기가 하나가 됐다. 새 크레이트 `crates/refset`(호스트 전용, gguf와 thiserror에만 의존)이 ik 노드 덤프(gpu-gates `lib.rs`에서 옮김), DSpark 드래프트 세트(게이트 넷의 사본 대신), greedy, KLD, 비전 세트를 열 이름으로 읽는다. 세트는 모두 계열 표(`src/arch/{deepseek41,deepseek41v}`)의 검사를 거쳐 열린다. 첫 샤드의 전체 경로가 트리가 돌리는 파일과 문자열로 같아야 하고, 계열의 ik 빌드·아키텍처여야 하며, 완결 표지가 있어야 한다. 아니면 `Stale`·`Foreign`·`Unfinished`로 이름을 대고 거절한다. Python 쪽은 `tools/bloomery/manifest.py` 하나다. 생성기 셋도 고쳤다. `ik-greedy.sh`·`ik-ppl.sh`는 다 쓴 파일만 이름을 바꿔 내놓고, `dump-draft.sh`의 교체 가드는 basename 대신 전체 경로를 비교한다. 라운드가 보인 증명: 두 ptx-scan 표가 베이스(`d02d4e6`)와 행·md5까지 같다. 판정 줄은 21개 게이트가 같고 14개는 다른데, 다른 곳마다 이유가 있다(옮긴 시험 수, 배치 레인, 3090/A6000 배정, 프로파일 시간). 제자리 세트 13개는 PASS다. 혼합 파일 사본 13개(ik 7, dsref 1, greedy 3, kld 2)는 경로로 읽혀 전부 이름 붙은 `Stale`이 됐다. 베이스의 KLD 게이트는 혼합 로그 옆에서 이름 없는 PPL 대역 빨강(Δln −0.1642, 대역 ±2.581e-4)이었는데, 이제 파일을 대고 거절한다. 예측이 빗나간 항은 하나다. `check-arch` ④가 공유 파일의 아키텍처 모듈 경로 11줄로 빨강이었고, 라운드는 검사를 고치지 않고 계열을 `src/arch/` 아래로 옮겨 닫았다. 리드 착륙: `e5cc69a` 위로 리베이스했다. 디바이스 크레이트 파일은 main과 한 줄도 다르지 않다. 두 ptx-scan 표는 `e5cc69a`의 표와 행·md5 블록까지 같다(`generate_ds41` 283줄, `gate_e2e` 173줄). 다른 곳은 머리줄의 `jit-card` 하나다. 이번 JIT는 A6000, 베이스는 3090에서 돌았다(둘 다 sm_86). 리드 묶음은 64항목이다. 라운드가 돌린 판독기 소비 게이트에 더해, 판독기를 부르는 bin인데 라운드가 뺀 17개(V2-Lite p0b·p4·p5·p6·p8·p8b, block·head·moe, qwen3moe e2e·experts, ds41 comp·engram·hc·index·rope·woa)를 넣었다. 판독기 호출을 grep해서 골랐다. 결과는 `DONE total=64 red=0 wall=757s lint_warnings=133`이다(예측 580 s[유도], 재빌드 항 없음). gates-lib는 42개 통과다(records 뒤 46개에서 refset으로 옮긴 5개를 빼고 묶는 시험 1개를 더했다). 뺀 것: `gate-gpu-ds41-{prefill,chat,serve,draft,dspark-loop,faults,lib}`와 `gate-gpu-e2e`는 판독기를 부르지 않는다(bin grep rc 1). faults는 long bin의 `--faults` 모드이고, 바뀐 줄은 `--free` 안에 있다. `run-ds41-ppl`(상한 1,680 s)은 같은 `refset::kld::check` 호출을 `gate-ds41-kld`가 제자리 세트와 혼합 사본 양쪽에서 이미 보였다. 리드가 고친 것 셋. DSpark 게이트 셋(`gate_dspark_{kv,experts,graph}.rs`)의 제자리 `BLOOMERY_DSPARK_MODEL` 읽기를 `refset::arch::deepseek41::dspark_model()` 하나로 모았다. 그래서 허용 목록은 라운드의 +1 대신 한 줄 줄었다(48 → 47줄, 읽기 −2). 목록에서 round가 `refset`이던 네 줄(`REF_CUDA`·`REF_SET`, `KLD_FILE`, `REF_CPU_SET`, `VISION_SET`)은 이 라운드가 바꿀 몫이 아니었으므로 `gatestoml`로 고쳐 적었다. AGENTS에는 Commands 두 줄, Layout 두 줄, 규약 "참조 세트는 판독기 하나"를 넣었다.
- **refset이 남긴 것(보고는 세션 밖 사본 `specs/wave-r2/reports/refset.md` 4·5절).**
  - **생성기의 새 경로는 아직 돈 적이 없다(XS, 다음 재취득 때).** `ik-greedy.sh`의 `.partial`, `ik-ppl.sh`의 `.log.part`는 `bash -n`과 shellcheck만 통과했다. 임대와 카드를 쓰고 `/root/bloomery-data`에 쓰는 실행이라, 다음 재취득(시팅)에서 처음 돈다. 그 시팅의 카드에 "완성 파일만 나타나는지"를 확인 항목으로 적는다. `ik-ppl.sh`는 `.kld.part`와 `.log.part`를 두 단계로 바꾸므로, 그 사이에 읽는 쪽은 새 베이스 옆의 옛 로그를 본다(임대 아래에서는 무해, XS). `ik-ppl.sh:266`의 `<tag>.out`은 실행 중에 덮어쓴다(게이트는 안 읽음, XS).
  - **도구로(XS–S).** `tools/ref/dump.sh:221`의 `model_of`도 basename을 비교한다. 지금은 `_plain` 접미가 막아 줄 뿐이다(XS). `dump-draft.sh:81`은 게이트 락에 raw `flock -w 1800 8`을 건다. `gpu-gate.sh` 밖의 둘째 주인이고, 락을 쥔 채 임대를 기다린다(S). `dump-draft.sh:33,35`와 `build-dump-draft.sh:25`의 `BASE_SHA=db517b69`·`DRAFT_MODEL`은 계열의 `IK_BUILD`, 프로필의 `DSPARK_MODEL`과 겹친다(S, `gatestoml`). `check-int-twins.py`의 기본 대상 `$BLOOMERY_DATA/ref`는 트윈이 생기기 전의 세트라 늘 빨강이다(52건, 베이스도 같음, XS).
  - **라우터 트레이스와 빈도 목록의 출처(M, V4.1 카드 경로).** `router/*` 트레이스는 혼합 파일과 ik `c10fbbcc`에서 떴다(트레이스 `MANIFEST.tsv`의 `# model` 줄). 모든 prose 타이밍이 켜는 384개 빈도 목록 파일도 그 횟수에서 배웠다. 목록 머리는 샤드 이름만 적어 두 파일을 가르지 못한다. `router-coverage.py:253`과 목록 작성기의 48행은 basename을 비교할 뿐이고 출처 검사가 없다. 라우터 계열을 refset에 두고, 공개 파일에서 트레이스를 다시 떠 목록을 다시 배운다(rig-log 09-23 두 절에 출처를 덧붙였다, `779b3e5`).
  - **refset 후속(S, 한 라운드로 묶는다).** KLD 판정이 결과 줄의 `kld_sha256=`(`ik-ppl.sh:328`)을 보지 않아, 크기가 같은 다른 베이스가 통과한다(XS). 신원 핀에 크기(또는 헤더 digest)를 더하면 같은 경로에서 다시 양자화한 파일을 잡는다(S). `refset-check`의 FAIL 줄에 계열의 `recipe`와 `consumers`를 찍으면 디버깅이 한 줄로 끝난다(XS). deepseek2·qwen3moe에도 노드 덤프 계열을 두면 `oracle/mod.rs`의 두 규칙(`open`은 arch 줄 없는 세트를 받고 `open_named`는 거절)이 하나가 된다(S). `Family::consumers`는 justfile이 이미 아는 사실의 둘째 주인이다. `recipes.py check`가 각 이름이 레시피인지 보게 하거나 필드를 뺀다(XS, 리드가 본 것). `crates/model/tests/ds41_host.rs:2`의 문서 주석에 `# build db517b69`가 남았다(핀 사본, XS). `data_dir()`는 UTF-8이 아닌 `BLOOMERY_DATA`를 기본 경로로 삼킨다(값을 삼키는 읽기 항목에 더한다).
  - **[03]으로(S).** `gate_qwen3moe_e2e.rs:1449`의 Qwen3 KLD 판독기에는 계열이 없다(n_vocab만 본다). `arch/qwen3moe`에 KLD 계열을 둔다.
  - **3파동 `session`으로(S).** 프롬프트 행 판독기가 셋이다(`prompts.rs:72 read_prompts`, `gate_deepseek41_dsloop.rs:105`, `generate_ds41.rs:345`). 셋 다 `prompt<P>.tsv`의 모델 줄(이제 전체 경로)을 읽지 않는다.
  - **`gatestoml`로(XS).** 남은 제자리 `BLOOMERY_DSPARK_MODEL` 읽기(`gate_dspark_hc.rs`, `gate_dspark_read.rs`, `shared/ds41_dspark.rs`, `v41fixture.rs`)도 `dspark_model()` 하나를 부를 수 있다(`v41fixture.rs`는 model 크레이트라 dev 의존만 있어 제외).
- **착륙 기록 (`toolsw2` `c2bea7b`).** 도구의 조용한 실패 아홉을 닫았다. 엔진 파일은 하나도 바뀌지 않았다. T1: `recipes.py`는 `#[cfg(test)]` 아래 모듈과 그 안의 literal·include를 자기 target의 시험 빌드에만 넣는다. 그래서 `tools/levers-direct.txt` 한 줄 편집이 고르는 게이트가 88개에서 1개(gate-levers)로, 스키마 jsonl 편집은 61개에서 3개로 줄었다. 레시피 130개의 closure가 파일을 잃기만 했다. T2: `BLOOMERY_BOX_READONLY=1`은 동기화도 mkdir도 하지 않는다. 원격 디렉터리가 없으면 66이다. 시팅 옆에서 읽기만 해도 커밋 안 한 편집이 실행 중인 스크립트 밑의 파일을 바꾸던 길이 닫혔다. `just box-gc`는 스크립트를 stdin으로 보낸다. T3: C++ 쓰기 가드 셋(`dump_ref`·`dump_draft`의 `BLOOMERY_REF_WRITE`, `router_trace`의 `BLOOMERY_ROUTER_WRITE`)은 값을 읽는다. 정확히 `1`이면 쓰고, 없거나 `0`이면 3, 그 밖은 이름을 대고 64다. 전에는 `0`이나 `yes`도 오라클 세트를 덮어쓸 수 있었다. T4: 러너 셋의 `BLOOMERY_GATE_BOUND`는 파서 하나(`tools/gate-bound.sh`)가 읽는다. 전에는 `gate.sh`가 `0`·`00`·빈 값을 "상한 없음"으로 받았다. T5: 새 게이트 `gate-gpu-ds41-flowcounts`가 흐름 모형의 큐 항목 수를 엔진의 카운터에 문다(P 512, G 기본과 G 1). FAIL-first는 `d2e42d3` 앞의 표지 셋 모형(shadow +1 × 40, `counts: DIFFER`)이다. G 1 팔은 P 512에서 배치가 하나라 순서의 증거는 아니고, `call plan group=1` 대응과 레버 파싱만 고정한다. T6: `ds41pp.py`는 B1 뒤의 트레이스를 `call lb`의 sub-block으로 자른다. 박스에 B1 뒤 트레이스가 없어 증거는 코드에서 옮긴 합성 트레이스뿐이다. 실제 트레이스 하나가 첫 확인이다. G ≥ 2 교차는 이름을 대고 거절한다. T7: `nsys-ds41.sh --analyze`가 `--plan`을 넘긴다. T8: 흐름 모형의 죽은 인용을 고쳤다. T9: 피처가 필요한 gpu-gates bin 58개에 `required-features`를 달았다. 피처 없이 지으면 cargo가 거절하므로, 스캔이 트랙의 바이너리를 더미 main으로 덮던 부류(09-25, 09-27)가 닫혔다. 리드가 더한 것: `check-recipes`가 파이썬 도구 여덟의 자체 시험을 돈다(맥 약 2.3 s). 전에는 어떤 레시피도 부르지 않던 시험이다. 자체 시험을 가진 도구가 목록에 없으면 빨강이다. `gate-*` 레시피가 바이너리를 `cargo run`으로 돌리면 빨강이다(상한과 러너 종료 코드가 없다). 그 첫 대상 `gate-gpu-block`은 `host-gate.sh`로 감쌌다. `box.sh`의 mkdir ssh에 `-n`을 붙였다. FAIL-first는 둘 다 봤다. main의 justfile에서 `cargo run` 규칙이 `gate-gpu-block`을 잡고, 목록 밖 도구와 실패하는 자체 시험이 각각 이름으로 빨강이다. AGENTS에 여섯 문장(READONLY는 동기화하지 않음, bound 파서, `required-features` 규약, cfg(test) closure, check-recipes의 두 규칙과 자체 시험), `docs/oracle.md`에 가드 값 규칙을 넣었다. 리드 묶음: `DONE total=23 red=0 wall=616s lint_warnings=133`(예측 227 s[유도]; Cargo.toml이 바뀌어 gpu-gates bin을 다시 지은 시간이 빠졌다 — 재빌드 항 도구 항목과 같은 부류). ptx-scan 두 표는 main과 행·md5 블록까지 같다(머리줄의 JIT 카드만 다르다). 착륙하면 `box.sh`가 BOX_GLOBALS라 원장의 녹색 키가 전부 한 번 움직인다(회귀 아님).
- **toolsw2가 남긴 것(보고는 세션 밖 사본 `specs/wave-r2/reports/toolsw2.md` 4·5절).**
  - **도구로(XS–S, 다음 도구 라운드).** flowcounts가 자기 입력(`tools/bloomery/records.py`, `schema/generate_ds41.jsonl`, `tools/flow/plans/*.rec`)의 변경에 선택되지 않는다. 스크립트 walk(`recipes.py` `script_closure`)가 파이썬 import와 데이터 경로를 따라가지 않는다(XS–S). `recipes.py`의 `_MOD`는 한 줄짜리 `#[cfg(test)] mod x;`와 `#[path=…] mod x;`를 놓친다(S). `card-tests/run.sh`에 READONLY가 동기화하지 않는지와 rc 66을 보는 시험이 없다(XS). READONLY도 맥의 `BLOOMERY_GIT_COMMIT`을 export하는데, 원격 트리는 동기화되지 않았으니 트리와 어긋날 수 있다(`box.sh:174-177`, XS). C++ 쓰기 가드가 세 파일에 같은 모양으로 있다(공유 헤더 후보, XS). flowcounts가 실패하면 박스의 `target/flowcounts-gate/`에만 로그가 남는다. 레시피가 실패 때 `--counts` 출력 끝을 찍게 한다(XS, 리드가 본 것).
  - **`levers2`로(XS).** `crates/levers/src/registry.rs`의 `BLOOMERY_GATE_BOUND` 행: `Kind::Count`의 `u64::from_str`는 `007`·`+5`를 받지만 러너는 이제 거절한다. `Site::Runner{file:"tools/gate.sh"}`는 러너 셋 중 하나만 가리키고, 이 literal 때문에 `tools/gate.sh`가 levers를 링크하는 모든 bin의 closure에 들어간다(`why tools/gate.sh` 95개).
  - **다음 삭제 묶음으로(S).** gpu-gates `src/bin`의 `cfg(not(feature…))` 더미 `main` 58개는 `required-features` 뒤로 죽은 코드다(예: `gate_q4k_sel.rs:46`).
  - **4파동 `gatesproc`로(M).** `generate_ds41`가 한 적재에서 두 G 값을 돌리면 flowcounts가 117 s에서 약 70 s로 준다[유도]. G는 적재 때 크기(`group_sets`)라 엔진 변경이 든다.
  - **다음 덤프 시팅의 운영 메모(XS).** `dump.sh`는 `just build-ref-dump`(소스 sha 기록)가 먼저 필요하다. 설치된 `dump_draft`는 다시 링크하기 전까지 옛 가드를 쓴다. `router_trace`는 실행마다 새로 짓는다.
  - **확인만 남은 것.** T6의 인코딩은 실제 B1 뒤 트레이스(nsys P 512 한 번)로 처음 확인된다. 다음 V4.1 nsys 시팅의 카드에 넣는다. P 4096의 G ≥ 2 교차는 아직 자르지 못하고 거절만 한다(`ds41pp.py:301`).
- **착륙 기록 (`del2` `e28c7e2`).** 사용자 결정 1·4·8(09-27)을 코드로 옮겼다. D1은 stage 0 크레이트 셋(q3k-gemv, q3k-cpu, gpu-spike)과 그 러너·하네스 여섯, 레시피 여섯을 지웠다. gpu-spike의 검사 다섯 가운데 둘(eager = replay, 캡처 몸체가 실패하거나 패닉해도 스트림을 다시 캡처할 수 있음)은 `crates/gpu`의 hw 시험으로 옮겨 gate-gpu-lib가 돈다. y_ref 대조는 gate-gpu-p1의 Q4_K 사례가 이미 잡는다. cooperative `two_phase`는 엔진에 cooperative 런치가 없어 커널과 함께 은퇴했다. 나머지 둘은 판정 없이 찍기만 하던 수치다. D2는 split-K Q3_K gemv(커널 셋과 규칙)와 `BLOOMERY_Q3K_SPLIT`·`_ITERS`를 지웠다. 기본 폭이 1이었으므로 남은 `enqueue_gemv_q3k`·`_groups`는 base의 분할 없는 가지와 런치 인자까지 같다. D3는 launch 스레드(`model/launcher.rs`, `libc` 의존)와 `BLOOMERY_LAUNCH_THREAD`를 지웠다. `replay_graph`는 base launcher의 `None` 가지에서 카운터 둘을 뺀 것이다. 기록에서는 load의 두 필드와 STEP_STATS의 네 필드(`go_early_first`, `launch_us`, `first_serve_lag_us`, `launch_wake_us`)와 그 평균이 빠졌다. 읽던 도구는 없다. 세 이름은 등록부의 Retired 행이라 `main`에서 거절된다. D4는 혼합 파일의 핀과 분기를 지웠다. placement 시험의 핀과 절(`file_pins()`는 핀이 없는 파일에 이름을 대고 패닉), `v41::MIXED`, inventory의 참조 파일 열, oracle 시험의 분기, 프로필의 `V41_MIXED`와 산문, gate-1-1의 빈 접미 분기다. lint는 133에서 48로 줄었고(예측 48[유도]), `undocumented_unsafe_blocks`는 58에서 0이 됐다. 라운드의 증명(`d9b6227` 위): ptx-scan 두 표가 base에서 정확히 넷(`q3k_gemv_split{,_groups,_mcol}`, `two_phase`, 8줄)을 뺀 것과 같고, gate-ptx-spill은 tsv 8행을 빼기 전 그 넷에서 빨강, 뺀 뒤 녹색이다. 옮긴 캡처 시험의 FAIL-first는 변이 셋(아무것도 안 하는 launch, Err 가지에서 EndCapture 건너뜀, 패닉 가지에서 건너뜀)이 각각 3·1·1 빨강이었다. 판정 줄은 gates-lib, placement, 1-1, mcol, ds41-step·prefill·draft·chat·serve·dspark-loop가 base와 같고, e2e는 카드 줄만, gpu-lib는 시험 둘이 바뀌었다(15 = 15). 리드 fixup: AGENTS의 stage 0 줄들(장치 크레이트·Mac·측정 러너 문장, Commands 넷, Layout 둘, lint 기준선 48과 unsafe 0, MUL-11 문장), CONTRIBUTING과 docs/BUILD의 러너·크레이트 이름, justfile 주석 둘(gate-gpu-lib의 hw 시험이 하는 일, p-게이트 위의 카드별 락). 리드 묶음(`b437046` 위로 리베이스): DONE total=33 red=0 skipped=0 wall=6426s laneA=6335s laneB=549s laneX=91s lint_warnings=48. ptx-scan은 main의 표에서 그 넷을 뺀 것과 main `e039209`의 표(03의 oxpin 증명)에서 그 넷을 뺀 것과 같다 — 표 4행·md5 4행씩(282 → 274, 172 → 164줄), 나머지 행·md5 전부 동일.
- **del2가 남긴 것(보고는 세션 밖 사본 `specs/wave-r2/reports/del2.md` 4·5절).**
  - **코드 모양으로(S–M).** `crates/gpu/src/cores.rs:975–1150`의 `*_span`이 받는 `it0..it1`은 split 커널만 쓰던 인자이고, 이제 늘 `0..iters`다. 접으면 md5가 움직이므로 ptx-canon과 비트 게이트가 있는 라운드에서 한다.
  - **도구로(XS–S).** `tools/gate-batch.sh:130`은 지운 `launcher.rs:278`을 인용하고, `:256`의 `TIMED` 정규식은 지운 `measure|cpu-measure`를 이름으로 잡는다. `tools/ref/lease.sh:36`, `:285–296`의 `stage0-*` 증인 필드는 부르는 러너가 없다(시험은 `card-tests/run.sh:494–498`). 프로필은 공개 파일이 아닌 V4.1 파일에서 `IK_NCMOE`·`LCPP_NCMOE`와 그 플래그를 두지 않는다. 그러면 `set -u` 러너가 `IK_GPU_FLAGS: unbound variable`(rc 127, `depth-ds41.sh:142`, `ik-draft.sh:75`)로 멈춘다. 사용처에서 `${IK_GPU_FLAGS:?…}`처럼 이유를 대고 거절하게 한다(XS).
  - **주석(S, 도구·코드 모양 라운드가 나눠 받는다).** 지운 파일을 가리키는 주석이 남아 있다: `tools/ref/cards.sh:8`, `tools/box.sh:7`, `tools/ref/build-qdot-ref.sh:13`, `tools/ref/dequant_ref.cpp:185`, `tools/ref/q4k_x4_ref.cpp:9`, `crates/gguf/src/quant.rs:4`·`:441–443`, `crates/threads/src/lib.rs:11–14`·`:534`, `crates/model/src/bin/bloomery-decode.rs:7`, `crates/model/src/ops.rs:2`([03]), `crates/gguf/RESULTS.md:81–100`.
  - **박스 데이터(혼합 파일 삭제와 같은 창).** 이제 아무도 읽지 않는 `/root/bloomery-data` 파일 21개(`attn.q4k`, `gate.q3k`, `big.q3k`, `output.q6k`, `x_m{1,8}.f32`, `y_ref_*.f32` 12개, 최상위 `q3k_ref`, `bin/q3k_ref`, `bin/q3k_cpu_ref`; 합 654,450,416 B)를 지운다. 지우기 전에 트리 grep으로 읽는 곳이 없음을 다시 본다.
- **착륙 기록 (`lockfix` `b437046`, 리드 fixup).** 두 카드 적재가 A6000 게이트 락 없이 돌던 결함을 닫았다. 결함은 이랬다. `stage-gpu-load-v41`·`-lock`은 box.sh의 `BLOOMERY_CARD=both` 아래에서 gpu-gate.sh를 기본 카드로 불렀고, 그래서 두 카드 적재가 3090 락 하나만 쥐었다. 다른 트랙의 `any` 게이트는 A6000이 비어 보이면 거기에 올라갔다. r8host의 check 2 빨강이 이것이었고, 09-27 03의 묶음 2에서는 `gate-gpu-e2e`가 `DriverError(2, "out of memory")`로 끝났다. 그때 r8land의 stage 적재가 A6000을 31.7 GB 쥐고 있었다. 고친 것은 셋이다. ① box.sh가 고른 카드를 박스에 `BLOOMERY_BOX_CARD`로 넘기고, gpu-gate.sh는 그 카드의 락을 잡는다. `both`면 3090 락을 먼저 잡고, 쥔 채로 A6000 락을 기다린다. 다른 실행은 락을 하나만 쥐므로 이 순서로는 교착이 없다. `BLOOMERY_GATE_CARD`가 다른 카드를 가리키거나 한 카드만 보이는데 `both`면 락을 열기 전에 64로 거절한다. stage 레시피는 고치지 않았다. ② 첫 설계는 "둘 다 비었을 때만 잡는" 5초 폴링이었는데, 다른 트랙 게이트가 도는 동안 한 번은 215 s, 다음에는 5분 넘게 굶었다. 그래서 막혀 기다리는 순서 대기로 바꿨다. ③ `/root` 락 파일을 못 여는 셸(root가 아니거나 박스가 아님)은 30분 동안 "경쟁"으로 돌다가 75로 끝났는데, 이제 이름을 대고 69로 바로 끝난다. FAIL-first는 박스의 실제 락으로 했다. 두 카드 잡이 25초 쥐는 동안 `any` 탐침을 넣었다. main에서는 탐침이 A6000에서 1초 만에 돌았고(1790461083.38, 쥐는 구간 ~1082.0–1107.0), 고친 트리에서는 쥐는 구간(1543.1–1568.1)이 끝난 뒤에 돌았다(1594.8. 끝난 뒤의 26초는 멈춘 첫 시도의 폴러가 그 틈에 두 락을 25초 잡은 몫이다). Mac 스텁 시험 일곱(거절 여섯, 락 파일 열기 하나)은 card-tests에 있어 check-recipes가 돈다(219/0). 리드 묶음은 `DONE total=6 red=1 wall=292s`였고 빨강은 이 변경 자신의 것이었다. gate-batch.sh에 새로 쓴 이유 문자열 "`…; gpu-gate.sh takes its gate lock`"을 걷기 도구가 명령 위치의 호출로 읽어 check-recipes와 smoke를 3090 고정으로 분류했다. 문구를 바꾸고, 걷기 도구가 gate-batch.sh 자기 텍스트를 읽지 않게 했다(`RUNNER_SELF`, FAIL-first 확인). check-recipes를 다시 돌려 ok였다. stage-gpu-load-v41은 레시피 수정 없이 "on both cards, both gate locks (asked both)"로 녹색 161 s였다.
- **lockfix가 남긴 것.**
  - **`levers2`로(XS, 착륙 때 리드가 확인).** 새 이름 `BLOOMERY_BOX_CARD`는 box.sh가 모든 박스 명령에 넘긴다. levers2의 L2(모르는 `BLOOMERY_*` 거절)가 착륙하려면 등록부에 이 이름의 비레버 행이 있어야 한다. 없으면 L2를 받는 바이너리가 전부 거절로 빨강이 된다. levers2의 상설 check-levers 규칙이 리베이스 때 이것을 잡아야 한다.
  - **도구로(XS–S).** 묶음 도중 트리 편집. 리드가 lockfix 묶음이 도는 워크트리에서 gate-batch.sh를 고쳤다가 되돌렸다. 본체가 차선들을 `for … wait` 복합 명령 안에서 기다리는 중이라 새 바이트를 읽지 않았지만, bash는 스크립트를 조금씩 읽고 뒤 항목은 동기화 시점의 트리를 시험한다. 묶음이 시작할 때 트리 상태(HEAD + `git status --porcelain`의 해시)를 적어 두고, 항목마다와 DONE 앞에서 비교해 바뀌었으면 결과를 무효로 이름 붙여 끝내게 한다. 러너 자신은 시작할 때 임시 사본으로 exec한다.
  - **도구로(XS).** 걷기 도구의 호출 패턴은 명령 위치(`;` 뒤)에 오는 문자열도 호출로 읽는다. 자기 파일은 이제 건너뛰지만, 다른 스크립트의 파이썬 문자열이나 heredoc에 같은 모양이 들어가면 같은 오분류가 난다. `MESSAGE`가 echo·printf만 거른다.
  - **그대로 둔 것.** 명시한 `a6000`(차선 B)이 타이밍 임대를 보지 않는 항목(`gpu-gate.sh`, 위 「게이트 시간 계획」 줄)은 이번에 손대지 않았다. `dump-draft.sh`·`dump-vision.sh`가 임대를 쥔 채 gpu-gate.sh를 부르는지부터 읽어야 한다. 부른다면 임대 검사는 교착이 된다.
- **`sessiondesign` 보고(09-27 아침, 설계, 박스 없음, 메모 `docs/research/session-design.md`).** 3파동 `session`의 설계다. 드라이버 셋(`generate_ds41`의 `drive`, lib `Generator`, `Ds41Engine`)과 표면 셋이 가진 사실을 표로 세었고, 위치 하나에 주인이 넷이다(`GpuModel.pos`, `Body.history`, `Ds41Engine.pos`, `Slot.held`). 모양은 크레이트 셋이다. `runtime`(호스트 전용: 생성 루프 하나, `Target`·`Verify`·`Draft`·`Advance`, `Lookup`), `app`(GPU: `Session<B>`, 엔진 스레드, bin `bloomery run|chat|serve|bench`), `serve`(HTTP, 요청 단위 `Engine`). 드래프트(n-gram, DSpark, MTP)는 `Draft<T: Verify>` 하나로 받고, 토큰 경로에 `dyn`이 없다. 순환 상태의 롤백은 m 레인과 장치 스칼라 커밋 레인(b)이 먼저다. mainline과 mistral.rs의 공통 핵이고, Qwen3.6에서 m = 8일 때 추가 0.66 ms 이하다[유도]. mistral.rs의 전이 로그(d)는 GLM의 수락률 자료가 나온 뒤다. chat을 배치 피드로 바꾸면 산문 P 512에서 약 4.8배, P 4096에서 6.5–7.4배다[유도, 스텝 피드는 디코드 속도로 대신 쟀다]. 리드 처분: 모양을 받는다. 라운드는 `session` → `oneloop`(chat 배치 피드는 opslib이 V4.1 계약을 밴드로 바꾸기 전에 비트 동일로 증명) → `draftserve` ∥ `cli`, `seqstate`는 `oneloop`부터 나란히다. 3파동의 `session` 칸에서 이어지고 4파동으로 넘친다. `gatesproc`(GD3)보다 **먼저** 간다(GD4의 순서를 뒤집는다: argv 심이 레시피·러너·레코드를 바이트 그대로 두므로, gatesproc은 in-process 케이스를 `Session`에 대고 한 번만 쓴다). serve의 페널티 이력은 mainline 규칙(프롬프트 + 생성)으로 한다. 오늘은 페널티에 닿을 길이 없어 보이는 변화가 없다. gpumodel이 열어 둔 여섯 가지(`Rows`의 m은 연관 상수, 그래프 키는 행 수 하나, 명시적 `capture(Rows(m))`, `Prompt` 능력, MTP를 위한 `Weights` 공유, 위치의 쓰기 하나)는 gpumodel 스펙에 넣었다. 라운드의 READONLY 호출 두 번이 메인 트리를 `~/repo/bloomery`에 동기화했는데, 그때 거기서 돈 잡은 없었다(두 리드의 묶음과 시팅은 모두 트랙 디렉터리에서 돌았다). 이 부류는 toolsw2 T2가 닫았다.
  - **3파동 `session` 라운드들이 가져갈 것(XS–S).** `bind.rs:167-174`의 샘플러 오류 → argmax 폴백(조용한 실패, S). `api.rs:480-481`과 `:546-583`: 모르는 필드(페널티)는 무시하면서 `generation_settings`는 중립 페널티를 보고한다(S). `genloop.rs:371`의 단일 EOS 정지 대 `eog()` 집합(S). `Ds41Engine.pos` 셋째 위치 사본(XS). `Place` 열거형 둘과 `print_plan` 넷(S). `generate.rs:1-4`의 "one real step per id" 문서와 `serve/src/sampling.rs:1-3`의 틀린 머리말(XS씩, `oneloop`에서 사라진다). `generate_ds41.rs:1413-1415` `feed_dspark`의 문서가 "one step each"라 하는데 배치 팔은 `prefill_with`를 돈다(XS). `bloomery_chat.rs:298`은 greedy에도 로짓 전체 517,120 B를 토큰마다 읽는다(스텝의 0.12 %[유도], 한 루프로 사라진다). `record.rs:1020` `LISTENING` 머리가 바이너리 이름을 박았다(XS, 스키마 VERSION 2 때).
  - **4파동 이상으로(M).** `body.rs:1229-1237`(`Holds`, 비율 슬롯): m > 2 검증이면 len − 1 아래 홀수 위치로 되돌리지 못한다. exllamav3는 투영 행 PAGE_SIZE + m의 링을 둬 256 안의 되감기를 커서 이동으로 하고, mainline은 압축기 상태에 스냅숏 평면을 준다. V4.1 행이 2를 넘기 전(DSpark 블록 5)에 필요하다.
  - **문서 고침(XS).** `docs/research/audit/gates-ds41.md:159`는 `gpu-ab.py`를 `generate_ds41` 독자로 적었는데, 그것은 V2-Lite `generate`만 읽는다. `audit/ds41.md:228-230`의 DS3 앵커가 낡았다. `audit/cpu.md` CPU5의 `slot_save_path` 인용은 `:188`이 아니라 `:200`이다. 위 「열린 라운드 카드」의 q35 사슬 행(`q35gdn`)의 "exllamav3 히스토리 슬롯 + 핑퐁"은 틀렸다: exllamav3는 기록 슬롯을 0번 슬롯으로 **복사**하고, 레인 색인은 mainline과 mistral.rs의 모양이다(그 자리에서 정정했다).

### 재구성 파동 1과 specdesign이 남긴 것 (09-27, `35c95ec`..`ef80083`)

조용한 실패 쪽이 먼저다. 커널을 건드리는 항목은 다음 V4.1 커널 라운드의 첫 항목으로 묶는다(GPU 착륙 목록 전체가 따라온다).
- **착륙 기록.** 1파동 `35c95ec`..`5cd4859`(09-27 00:17): 리드 묶음 34항목 rc 0, wall 853 s(예측 846 s[유도]), lint 144 → 133. ptx-scan은 지운 엔트리(generate_ds41 17개, gate_e2e 15개)를 뺀 모든 행과 md5가 베이스와 같다. md5가 움직인 둘(`flash_latent`, `flash_latent_q8`)은 `ptx-canon`이 reordered-only(독립 쌍)라 했고 자원 열도 같다. 돌린 게이트는 삭제가 닿은 것들이다: ds41-prefill·q4k-sel·draft·ds41-lib, ds41-step·attn·ds41-host·p0b·moe·gates-lib, e2e·p4·p5·p8·p8b·head·mcol·hybrid·gpu-lib·qwen3moe-e2e, engram·ds41-engram·lab-engram·ds41-plan, 정적 검사와 ptx-spill. 뺀 것은 prefill-q3ksplit, long, faults, chat, serve, dspark 넷, p1·p2·p3·p6·p9·p10·iq·block이다. 근거는 셋이다: 남은 엔트리의 PTX가 같고, `just lint`(clippy, `--features gpu`·`deepseek41`)가 모든 게이트 바이너리의 본문을 검사했고, 지운 이름을 문자열로 부르는 게이트가 없다(grep). 판정 줄은 베이스와 대조해 예고한 차이만 났다: prefill의 이식 케이스·적재 줄(배치 버퍼 761,556,192 → 758,283,552 B)·지운 런처 이름, step의 어휘 밖 id 거절 문구, e2e의 스칼라 팔 줄. ctxcap `ef80083`은 호스트 전용이다(두 ptx-scan 표가 `5cd4859`와 같음). 돌린 것은 step·prefill·draft·ds41-meta와 16,385 위치 효과 실행 한 번이다. 뺀 long(최대 330토큰)·faults(32스텝)·chat·serve(16토큰)는 16,384 위치에 닿지 않아 새 검사가 아무것도 바꾸지 않는다.
- **조용한 경로 셋(커널).** `q4k_sel.rs:160` `tile_at`이 `j >= start[e]`를 보지 않는다. run 앞을 가리키는 타일 단어가 다른 expert의 항목을 e의 가중치로 쓴다. 비교 하나에 게이트 케이스 하나다(S). `gpu-deepseek41/src/router.rs:280, :389`는 `n_expert ≠ N_EXPERT`이면 쓰지 않고 돌아간다. 호스트 검사(`:717`, `:780`)가 막아 도달할 수는 없지만, 규칙대로 폴트 단어를 올린다(XS). `gpu-deepseek41/src/indexer.rs:136-141`의 `relu`는 NaN을 +0으로 바꾸고, indexer 커널에는 폴트 싱크가 없다. indexer의 query나 weights에 NaN이 들면 그럴듯한 점수와 목록이 조용히 나온다 → 폴트 사이트 하나(S, candmask가 찾음).
- ~~**V4.1 후보 마스크 구축(M).**~~ R1(커널)과 R2(배선, `candwire` 2251355f)가 착지했다. 16,384를 넘는 위치에서 24·28·32·36층의 top-k는 20층이 고른 블록 안에서 뽑힌다. 깊이 증명은 두 갈래다. 착지 배치는 `gate-gpu-ds41-chain-attn`의 G2s(합성 KV, 16,384/16,385, 24,576, 32,768)를 돌리고, 실제 모델에서 보는 G2·G2b는 `weekly-gpu-ds41-cand`에만 있다. R3(ik 쪽 마스크)과 `candref`, `shadowlite`는 남아 있다. 설계는 끝났다: `docs/research/candmask-design.md`(조사 라운드 `candmask`, 09-27). 의미는 참조 28줄로 정해지고 리드가 원본(`model.py:498-506`, `:560-612`)에서 확인했다. 20층이 자기 점수로 블록을 고르고, 소비자는 24·28·32·36층 indexer다. 첫 두 게이트는 외부 오라클 없이 비트 단위로 본다. 비용은 어느 깊이에서도 스텝의 ±0.1 % 안이다[유도]. 처분은 재구성 파동 안이다. 커널(R1)은 3파동 `opslib`에 모델 이름 없는 계열로, 배선(R2)은 4파동 `layerprog`에 들어간다(후보 소스를 CED 소스 하나로 더하고, 거절은 삭제 클래스로 걷는다). 그때까지 16,384를 넘는 위치는 이름 붙은 거절로 남는다. ik 쪽 마스크(R3)는 파생 트리(db517b69 + 마스크, `ik-dspark-draft`와 같은 모양)에 짓는다. 후보 세트(d1c, d3)가 제 계열·빌드 id를 가지므로 시팅 10이 다시 뜨는 세트에는 닿지 않는다. d3와 CPU 끝-끝 진실 실행(6–48분[유도])은 R4 때 사용자 승인 항목이다. `CTX_MAX`를 16,384로 줄여 봐야 카드 KV는 약 52.4 MB만 준다[유도]. 계획은 그대로 둔다.
- **다음 삭제 묶음(S).** engram `FillMode::Populate`와 `Site::populate`(판정 끝, 366.5 대 363.1 µs); `batch.rs:1934` `card: Option<CardStacks>` → `bool`(XS); `batch.rs:1769`의 1024 expert 버킷 한도를 첫 prompt batch가 아니라 적재 때 거절(S).
- **주인 하나로.** `gate_deepseek41_plan.rs`의 `fn engram`이 `token_rows`의 blocked 규칙 사본 → 아래 코드 모양 절의 `Hash::map_window`와 합친다(S). engram `KEY_PREFIX = "deepseek41."`(`hash.rs:41`) → `split.arch_key`(XS, 3파동 `modelspec`). `ds41_host.rs`의 `Set` 사본 → 2파동 `refset`(GG5). attn 게이트 `LayerCase`의 sinks = `model_sinks`, `SetInfo::threads`는 찍기만 함 → GD2.
- **도구(XS–S).** engram-reuse `ROW_BYTES 272`와 머리말의 194 GiB는 혼합 파일 값(공개 파일 행은 110 B) → 실험실이 파일에서 행 바이트를 읽게(S). `tools/flow/constants.tsv:135` `batch_bytes_g1`이 이번에 3,272,640 B 줄어든 트리를 설명하지 못함(읽는 곳 없음, XS). `tools/flow/ds41_prefill.py:300-301`의 `batch.rs` 줄 인용이 옮겨진 코드를 가리킴(XS). `tools/ptx-scan.sh`가 md5가 움직인 엔트리마다 `ptx-canon`을 불러 판정 줄을 붙이게(S). `verdict-diff.py` MASKS에 draft 요약의 `tok/s(positions)=`(XS). 헤더를 층 범위별 텐서 형식으로 찍는 `gguf-inventory --keys --layers`(S — specdesign이 또 손으로 만들었다).
- **3파동 `modelspec`·`session`으로.** 파일 대 상수 검사 열 개(`chain/attn.rs:801-813` 등, 첫 불일치에서 멈춤)를 커버리지 검사가 대신한다. qwen3moe `feed_forward_length` 6144를 읽지도 알리지도 않는다(L6, XS). serve가 DSML 도구 파서와 DeepSeek 추론 분리를 모든 템플릿에 건다(`api.rs:1550-1555`, `reasoning.rs:32`, S — 오늘 실제 엔진을 묶는 것은 `bloomery-serve-ds41` 하나라 사용자에게 보이는 결함은 아직 없다). `batch.rs`·`prefill.rs`에 남은 V4.1 전용 상수(`N_USED` 6, Q3_K 행 `110 * n_sb`, `BUCKET_*` 1024, HC 4·24, `T_MAX`, `CHUNK`, 큐 7) → `opslib`의 입력 목록.

### V4.1 카드 경로 (기준 행: 공개 파일 nsys `nsys-ds41-d6-n8-101249.sqlite`, A6000; 생성 스텝 31.6 ms(그 런의 `time step` 평균, 스텝 1–7) = 카드 임계 8.56 + 브리지 22.61 + 재생 사이 유휴 0.42 ms(생성 재생 6–12의 행). 24.06은 프롬프트 공급 재생 0–5까지 넣은 13재생 평균이었다. 공급 재생의 브리지가 23.6–28.8 ms로 더 길어서 합이 32.62가 됐다(09-27 `tools/ref/nsys-bridge.py`로 같은 sqlite를 다시 읽음); 브리지 = 36.0 + 119.5·k_host µs)

- 카드 여섯 위(D7·X1·A2·sinkhorn·B8·load3)는 「열린 라운드 카드」. 손대지 말 것: E1 카드 `_sel`(k_card ≤ 4에서 노출 틈 ≥ 98 µs — 3090 DSpark로 카드 몫이 커지면 슬롯 압축 목록 + live 행 grid-stride −3…−5 µs/런치), D8·D9·E2 그늘(shexp gate·up 두 walk, Q5_K f32 gemv u32 적재, Q4_K 9 SB 셋째 반복 — E2는 Qwen3 전 카드 down에서 임계, `qwen3bw`).
- `plan-ledger.md`의 "Q3_K 클래스 천장 = 명령 수 598"(3090 V2-Lite)은 kr-dense의 산수(발행 천장 1.28 TB/s, `engram_wkv` 674 GB/s)와 맞지 않는다 — **suspect**, 재유도 후보.
- 노출 항 레버(전부 [유도], 혼합 파일 시대의 순위 — 공개 파일 nsys(N2)로 다시 매긴다): norm을 앞 커널 마지막 블록의 Σx²로 접고 소비 gemv 프롤로그에서 스케일(−0.4…−0.6 ms, 노드 −80…−120, M; `fused.rs:88` norm_quant에 코어가 없어 3c도 막힘); combine + HC_POST + 접기 한 커널(1·14층은 engram 뒤에서 끊는다, S; 39층 ffn이 `head.input_mut()`에 바로 쓰면 −1노드); 32k top-k 여러 블록(M); rope 융합 — `q_rope`를 gemv 에필로그(−34 µs, M), ROPE_BACK을 merge로(S–M), pooled·index key·indexer_q rope를 이웃 에필로그(S), K/V 커널의 kv 두 번 읽기를 레지스터 + `shfl_xor(1)`(−18 µs, S); 압축기 — kv·score 1024행 한 런치(−14…−20 µs), rope 전 q8_1을 `ds41_comp_pool` 안으로(−5.8 µs), 인덱스 키 gemv·norm·rope·Hadamard 한 블록(−3…−4 µs), 압축기 사슬을 그래프 가지로; hc — HC_PRE f64 `exp` → f32(−25…−45 µs, ik 비트 동일이 밴드로 바뀌므로 두 배 탐침으로 값부터), engram gate f64 점곱(층 둘뿐, 작음); heads `row / rows_per_head` 21명령 나눗셈 → 2-D 격자(런치당 +1.64 µs 실측, `wo_a` 토큰당 ~66 µs; `kernels.rs:112,182,260`); 작은 격자 사이트를 그래프 병렬 가지(attn_q_a ∥ attn_kv, ≤ −0.32 ms, M); heads K ≤ 128 warp당 4행(float, M); int8 활성 + dp4a(정확도 클래스, L); V2-Lite 잔차 memcpy 핑퐁·`router_topk` 융합(−0.15…−0.2 ms)·norm 접기 — V2-Lite는 디딤돌이라 Qwen3 라운드가 대신.

### 호스트 expert 티어 (㊴ auditcpu, kr-cpu, cpu1–5)

- P3 층당 풀 디스패치 셋(wait_go, gate/up, down) = 토큰당 120회, 0.19–0.83 ms — go를 본 워커가 handoff에서 바로 행으로(−40회, S–M); P1 층 l+1 라우터를 층 l handoff에 미리 적용해 예측 expert 앞머리를 L3로(천장 −12.95 ms × 적중 h; E10 오프라인 h ≥ 0.4면 설계 카드, L); 128.4 대 147.7 GB/s의 13 % = 3.47 ms/토큰 — 대부분 잣대(147.7은 best-of-5, 같은 임대 140–144; `facts.md` STREAM 천장 주석 후보 K1), 나머지는 A(mlock mmap 대 THP 순수 읽기) → B·C·D; 호스트 다리의 두 그룹 디스패치가 직렬(expert마다 gate/up → down 한 작업, ≈6.9 µs/층, 두 배 탐침 먼저, M).

### DSpark·검증 패스

- dsloop·uniongroup·dspark-q3k는 카드. 남은 빈틈: clamp 경로에 끝에서 끝까지 오라클이 없다(`gate_dspark_graph` BAND_GAIN 8은 블록 3–11을 탭으로 판정할 때 clamp 켠 빨강을 FAIL-first로 재핀; 호스트 규칙은 silu(g)를 자르고 model.py는 g를 자른다, ≤ 4.5e-5[유도], XS); "우리 드래프트가 ik보다 낫다"는 이 빈틈부터.
- load3 남긴 것: 헬퍼 스레드가 스테이징을 쓰고 플래그도 직접 올리면 스텝 스레드가 0층 go에서 바로 서비스 → 이득이 R 전체(0.41–0.46 ms[유도], M — 다음 적재 라운드 첫 후보); `hybrid.rs:572-660` `op_*`/`mem_batch`/`capturing`·`:441` `MappedHost` 비공개라 `graph.rs`에 사본 → 주인 `graph.rs` 하나(S); 이미지 행 구역 중복 업로드(`params.rs:32-33`, `refresh_row` — 빼려면 `gate_deepseek41_load.rs:928-949` check iii 재조준, S); 락을 켜도 매 실행 step 26(위치 31)에서 헬퍼 밖 minor 2(첫 접촉 — `gate-alloc` 창 밖 할당 의심, XS–S 조사); step 게이트 `regions()`와 skew 게이트 그늘 순회가 같은 go/wait 구획을 두 번 구현 → `nodes.rs`(S); `gate-ds41-load` 이름이 `gate-gpu-ds41-*` 규칙 밖(XS). 공유 박스에서는 populate만으로 "fault 0"이 계약이 안 된다(다른 라운드 RSS가 회수) — fault 게이트는 락을 켜고 돈다.
- dsloop 남긴 것: 탭이 join과 다음 층 fork 사이 임계 경로에 있다(`body.rs:1426`) → 다음 층 MoE의 `ShadowWork`로 옮겨 숨김(행마다 7–12 µs[유도], S); `body.rs:914,916` 페이저블 `copy_to_host` → pinned(XS); `body.rs:647` `step_buffers()` 고정 길이 배열(버퍼 하나 더하면 호출부 전부, S); 프롬프트를 id마다 한 스텝으로 먹인다(`step(&ids)`는 마지막 위치 특징만 남김) → m행 프리필 경로의 탭(M); `generate_ds41.rs:725,970` `feed`/`feed_dspark` 중복, `:884` `Lookup`이 dspark에서도 생성(XS); `:1072` `Probe::read`가 타깃 카드 `mem_info`만(XS); `DraftBody`에 폴트 뒤 poisoned 상태 없음 — 서버 루프면 reset까지 거부해야(S, `draft/**`); 세트 대비 특징 밴드는 시팅 10 뒤(ik `dsv4_hc_mean_for_capture`와 합 순서 같음).
- dsgraph 남긴 것: router·shexp gate_up이 행마다 한 런치(`experts_mxfp4.rs:1044`, `experts.rs:353`, `block.rs:569,648` — m행 판이면 w 5에서 24노드 → 6, M); `block.rs:599` concat 플랜 dedup(M); `Head::with_m`이 gain·투영을 한 `Weights`에서(R14, S); `MxAct`/`Q8Act` 열 수 고정 → 폭별 버퍼(S); `block.rs:796` `stage`가 f32 네 스트림(bf16 한 행, S); `ds41_glue_embed` 런처 두 벌(S); `append`가 기다리지 않아 비동기 오류가 다음 `propose`에서(디버그 레버); prefill append(n > 8) eager; `gate_dspark_graph.rs:1152` tie 밴드·`:1328` `run()` 214줄(S); `router.rs:41,44` `N_EXPERT`/`N_USED` 컴파일 상수(128/3 드래프트 불가, S); `experts.rs:49` combine 슬롯 리터럴 6(S); `gguf/quant.rs:33` MXFP4(39) 없음(XS); `experts.rs:23` clamp 규칙 문서(XS).
- dspark-q3k 보고: `markov.rs:143` `p >= n_vocab`이면 0행을 읽는 clamp(조용한 실패 부류, 커널 시그니처에 FaultSink, S); `elem.rs:343,384` `embed_rows` 계열의 `id >= n_rows` → 0 clamp(같은 부류, S); `gate_dspark_graph.rs:215`·`gate_dspark_kv.rs:93` `read_set`이 세트의 `# model`을 안 본다(lib `:569-573`에 파서 있음; 넣으면 다른 파일의 세트는 잘못된 대조 대신 이름 붙은 거부 — kv의 공개 팔도 거부로 바뀐다, 시팅 10 뒤 S); `DraftBody`에 fault 뒤 poisoned 상태가 없고 sink가 `unlabelled_sink`라 `an unlabelled launch`로 찍힘(공유 `Gpu`에서 누가 지우나, 설계 메모 S — dsloop이 받는다); `arch/dspark.rs:449` `Borrowed::card_format` 문서가 bf16 행만(XS); `EmbdRows`가 `chain/glue.rs:86`(private)과 `draft/load.rs:43` 두 벌(S); `draft/mod.rs:221` 매 propose가 `split.find(token_embd)`(로드 때 한 번, XS); justfile `ptx-scan` 주석에 둘째 위치 인자 = 엔트리 필터, features는 `--features`로만(XS).
- E5·E19: 첫 드래프트는 DSpark가 아니라 n-gram lookup(D≈0; code 0.595·threads 0.477 > 손익분기 0.34, korean 0.288 불통과) — E5b·E19가 게이트 정책을 정한다(오라클 − 항상쌍 < 2 %면 버림).

### 게이트 하니스·테스트 env (① — 기계 라운드 하나, B4/B5 파동이 다 머지된 지금이 그때다)

- **overflow-checks 게이트 프로필**(S–M, 결정): release 게이트와 GPU 게이트는 정수 wrap이 조용하다(`gate-ops/attn/ffn/moe/head` 다섯만 dev라 켜져 있다, `justfile:455-467`). `[profile.gate] inherits = "release"`, `overflow-checks = true`, 디바이스 크레이트는 패키지별 off(cargo-oxide 주석: overflow-check MIR이 패턴 민감 디바이스 lowering을 깬다) — 게이트만 `--profile gate`. 대가: 타이밍 러너와 target 디렉터리가 갈려 게이트 빌드가 한 벌 더. 「조용한 실패」 규칙의 연장이라 리드 추천은 넣기; 다섯 dev 게이트도 같은 프로필로 통일(S).
- `.config/nextest.toml`이 박스에 `cargo-nextest`가 없어 죽은 설정(XS: 설치하거나 지운다 — 게이트는 `tools/gate.sh` → `cargo test`).
- **Instrument defect: batch order alone can turn `gate-gpu-ds41-residency`'s `resident` clause red** (S).
  - The clause asks `HostSet::serves`, which is `mincore` over the whole run (`crates/model/src/placement/host_lock.rs:365`). An item earlier in lane X that loads a large host set can evict V4.1 pages, and the clause then reads "not resident" for experts the load did hold.
  - Seen in land8b's batch on 09-30: 21 wrong after qwen4exp-e2e (~111 GB host set) and twocard in lane X, green
    on a solo rerun. The same clause's 1,574 wrong in fastupload's first batch was a real defect (page releases
    deferred to the end of the upload, so the tier card's pages evicted the host set) and went green only with the
    fix in `493ec88a` — the clause catches real evictions too, which is why it is worth fixing rather than dropping.
  - Two fixes are on the table:
    - Ask the clause right after populate, before the step runs.
    - Hold the expectation to a `mincore` snapshot taken at the end of the load.
  - Check in the same round whether the minflt pin on `gate-gpu-ds41-faults` (`gate_deepseek41_long.rs:463`, pin 2 per step) is the same class. It read 5 at step 26 in that batch and was green on rerun.

- **gatesaffected ① 착륙 `1ea27fa`**(09-25 밤, 대기 창 라운드; 맥 전용, Rust 무변경): `just affected [BASE|A..B]`(`tools/recipes.py` + `tools/affected-gates.sh`) — crate 그래프·모듈 트리·스크립트·cargo 전역으로 diff → `gate-*` 목록, `unmapped:`, 박스 dep-info 나이(읽기 전용 ssh, `--no-box`); `check-recipes`가 같은 파서로 모든 레시피의 타깃·feature·러너·스크립트를 cargo metadata에 대조(3.6 s, 자기 시험 92 레시피 + 변이 5). 리드 배치 대조: v4meta 21/84, fixup5 48/76, **ds41ced 21/59 — 빠뜨린 것 0, 도구 초과 중 `fault.rs`가 31(그래프의 참값), 14는 `gpu-deepseek41`을 링크하는데 그 묶음이 안 돌린 게이트**(hc·moe·chain-ffn·mcol·rope·comp·engram·chain-glue·woa·faults·ds41-load·dspark-hc/experts/graph). 앞으로 리드 묶음은 이 목록에서 시작하고 뺀 것은 사유를 적는다. 남은 것: ② 원장 층(M, 아래 원 카드), 1.5층 `#[cfg(feature)]` 반영 walk(M — cfg로 가린 `bind.rs`가 gpu 전용 게이트를 과선택), `$BLOOMERY_DATA`를 만드는 스크립트의 변경은 unmapped(원장 몫); 스펙 밖: `justfile` `gate-gpu-block`이 러너 없이 `cargo run`(900 s 상한 없음, S), `probe-gpu-real-x` 맨손 실행(S), `real_x`·`forced_probe`·`generate` bin은 어느 gate-*도 안 빌드(보고만).

- **`ptx-scan` columns for instruction shape** (S). Add three columns to the scan table: the entry's instruction count, the innermost loop body's instruction count (back-edge span), and the generic `ld`/`st` count (neither `.global`, `.shared`, `.param`, `.local` nor `.const`). The unsafe program's wave rule needs all three: the unsafew0 pilot's `next_cell` form cut `rms_norm`'s total from 143 to 142 while its apply loop went from 11 to 19 and its one `st.global` turned generic (Mac LLVM 21 over the box's IR). Depot, local and regs did not show it. The counter exists as a script, `specs/wave-m8/reports/unsafew0-box2/loops.py` in the lead's session, and should move into `tools/`. It shares a slot with ledger #20's normalized-instruction-stream md5 column. Add `stacksave` and `cvta.local` counts too: ledger #20's signature of inline helpers taking trait, `&mut` or closure arguments.
- **The move/delete proof passes a rewired operand** (S; the AGENTS.md wording is a user decision, so it stays here until then). The change-class table proves move and delete by an identical `ptx-scan` table, that is equal md5s, and runs `tools/ref/ptx-canon.py` only on rows whose md5 moved. `ptx::normalize` (`crates/gpu-gates/src/ptx.rs`) deletes register numbers before hashing, so `sub.f32 %r3, %r1, %r2` and `sub.f32 %r3, %r2, %r1` share an md5, as do swapped `div` and `fma` operands, a rewired operand and a retargeted branch. A wrong wiring therefore passes as a move. The unsafew0 pilot caught the gap on 2026-09-30 only because `ptx-canon` was run separately: `rms_norm`'s md5 equalled the base while canon found one (harmless) `mul.f32` operand swap. Proposed rule: move and delete proofs require a renumbered body comparison on every row, either `ptx-canon` identical or a renumbered-md5 column in the scan (registers, labels and depots renamed in order of first appearance, `ptx-canon`'s rule; bumps `ptx::DIGEST_METHOD`). FAIL-first: a mutant that swaps one `sub` operand passes today's rule and fails the new one. Until then, a move verdict states the `ptx-canon` verdict beside the md5.

### 코드 모양 (⑧ — 기계 라운드 묶음)

- **`unwrap_or*` 감사**(조용한 실패, slop 조사 C4, 읽기 라운드 S + 고침 S–M). `origin/main` `3750629`의 `crates/*/src`에 `unwrap_or*`가 515곳 있다(`unwrap_or_default()` 51곳; gpu-gates 192, refset 71, model 71, serve 54, gguf 30, gpu 23, 나머지 74). `tools/`와 justfile의 `|| true`는 74곳이다. 곳마다 셋 중 하나로 나눈다. ① 기본값 자체가 계약인 곳(CLI 기본 인자, ik가 같은 기본값을 쓰는 선택 메타 키)은 그대로 둔다. ② 없는 입력이나 틀린 입력을 그럴듯한 값으로 바꾸는 곳은 이름 붙은 오류로 바꾼다. 이미 트리아지에 있는 F12 `first_shard`, `moe.rs:159` `expert_weights_scale`, `host_lock.rs` sysconf 4096이 이 부류다. ③ 판단이 안 서는 곳은 목록으로 리드에게 넘긴다. 분류는 Mac 읽기 전용 라운드 하나로 하고, 고침은 파일 주인별로 나눠 다음 픽스업 묶음에 싣는다. 게이트 절은 ②로 바꾼 곳마다 FAIL-first 하나씩 둔다.

FAIL-first는 박스 CPU 빌드 둘에서 봤다(rig-log 09-28#ik-resok-utf8). 후보 여섯의 순위 조사(라운드 `ikrank`, 보고 사본 `specs/wave-m8/reports/ikrank.md`(세션 밖))에서 나머지 다섯은 낮음이다. `dsv4_append_zero_row`, split-K sink 누락(`iqk_flash_attn.cpp:403,455`, DSpark 드래프트 FA만 도달 미확인), `ple_eos_token_id`, perplexity 불일치 넷은 stock 경로로 출력이 바뀌지 않아 #2437처럼 닫힐 몫이다. 드래프트의 target `-ot` 상속은 속도만의 문제이고 #2366에서 설정 문제로 닫혔다. 다음 후보 둘: `-draft "<args>"`로 준 `-ot`·`--override-kv`가 드래프트에 먹지 않는다(target에 `-ot`가 있으면 종결자 뒤에 붙어 로더가 못 봄, `common/common.cpp:762-766`·`common/speculative.cpp:2025-2033`, 2–4줄, 중간). 채팅 EOS 경로의 잘못된 UTF-8 500은 #2554가 못 닫고 mainline #29161(M) 포트 몫이라, #2554 머지 뒤 이슈 한 줄로 둔다. #2554가 열려 있는 동안은 새 비드래프트 PR을 열지 않는다.

### 아이디어 원장 (외부 레포·조사에서 얻은 것 — 한 줄에 처분과 근거)

조사 대상에는 추론 엔진뿐 아니라 모델 변환·학습 도구(NVIDIA Model-Optimizer, llm-compressor, z-lab DFlash)도 넣는다. DSpark 작업이 09-24에 시작됐는데, ModelOpt의 DFlash 오프라인 학습(0.45, 07-06)을 09-28에야 봤다.

**NVIDIA Model-Optimizer `23355ed`** (조사 라운드 `modelopt`, 09-28; 보고 원문 `specs/research/modelopt-report.md`, 리드 세션 사본):
- **DFlash target 층 규약: 기록만.** ModelOpt의 `target_layer_ids`는 층 *출력*(`hidden_states[lid + 1]`, `hf_dflash.py:1044-1045`)이고, 서빙 캡처 id는 거기에 +1이다(`dspark.md` 표). 우리 [37, 38, 39]는 층 *입력*(`draft/mod.rs:12-15`)이라 ModelOpt id로는 [36, 37, 38], 캡처 id로는 [37, 38, 39]다. 두 규약이 한 칸 어긋나 있어서 변환기의 [38, 39, 40] 같은 +1 오류가 생기기 쉽다. 다만 V4.1 draft가 어느 층으로 학습됐는지를 독립적으로 증명하지는 않는다.
- **acceptance length 정의: 형식만 채택.** specdec_bench는 반복마다 낸 토큰 수의 평균이고(첫 프리필 토큰 포함, 턴 평균의 평균), 우리 positions/passes와 n = 96에서 −0.9 % 차이[유도]. 폭이 다른 AL끼리는 비교하지 않는다(그쪽 기본값 7, 우리 w = 1). w > 1 팔이 생기면 위치별 조건부 수락률을 `draft summary`에 한 줄 추가(XS).
- **V4.1 DSpark 재학습: 기각.** ModelOpt의 DSpark 바디는 Qwen3 dense 층이라 V4.1 모양 draft를 미세조정할 수 없다. w = 1에서 AL 상한은 2.0이므로 1.89에서 최대 +5.8 %[유도]다. 09-25 결정「드래프터 학습은 열지 않는다」를 유지한다.
- **draft 헤드 어휘 축소(`calibrate_frequent_vocab`)와 Markov W2 bf16: 기각.** 라운드는 draft 읽기를 제안당 1.45 GB, 2.1–2.6 ms로 잡고 절감을 0.72–0.89 ms로 예측했다. 그러나 rig-log 09-25 「짝 패스」 절이 이미 draft 본체와 특징 읽기를 패스당 0.3–1.6 ms로 쟀고, 패스가 스텝의 1.61배인 원인은 두 행 검증 패스 자체로 판명돼 있다(짝 패스, draft 없음, 1.58–1.61배). 이 레버들의 몫은 그 0.3–1.6 ms 안에 있어 잣대 아래다. 정정(09-28, `recentlit`): 오늘은 행당 호스트 다리 H가 카드 직렬 C보다 커서, 패스 = C_p + 2H(twoeng 모형, 실측 36 ms에 맞음)다. 카드 m행 런치는 어긋난 행 B의 카드 일을 없애지만, 그 일은 이미 A의 호스트 다리 그늘에 있어서 −0.8…+0.4 ms ≈ 0[유도]이다. 패스를 줄이는 것은 H다(적응형 residency, (b′), 행당 호스트 비용). m행 런치가 버는 것은 H < C가 된 뒤, (b′) + 적응형에서 +1.5–4.5 %[유도]다.
- **confidence head로 약한 제안 건너뛰기: 보류.** 우리 파일의 `conf_proj`는 적재만 되고 쓰이지 않는다(게이트 두 곳만 읽음). 패스 = 1.61 스텝이라 수락 확률이 p > 0.61[유도]인 제안만 이긴다. 평균 α가 0.89라 이득은 p < 0.61인 제안의 비율에 달렸다. 잴 항은 제안마다 confidence 출력과 실제 수락의 결합 분포 하나(박스 프로브, 기록 한 줄 추가가 필요). 검증 패스 레버 뒤에 둔다.
- **GGML IQ1_S / IQ2_XXS / IQ2_XS 인코더(0.48 미릴리스): 기각.** k-quant 인코더가 없고, 출력도 GGUF가 아니라 safetensors 블록이며, 보정 없이 균일하다. llama.cpp의 IQ 양자화는 imatrix 가중이 필수다(`ggml-quants.c:3302`, `:3338`). 우리 IQ 계획(IQ4_XS)과도 겹치지 않는다.
- **AutoQuantize(비용·Shapley): 「Qwen3.8 tiered requant」 보류 전제 불변.** 층 하나의 expert 전체가 한 포맷을 쓰고, 활성 비율은 top_k/N 균일값이다. KL을 비트 예산 안에서 줄일 뿐 품질 손실 자체는 남는다. 공개 파일이 아니게 되고, 후보 포맷에 k-quant가 없으며, BF16 역전파가 필요하다.
- **skip-softmax sparse attention(0.48 미릴리스): 보류, 사용자 결정 사항.** 출력을 바꾸는 손실 근사다(질량을 버린다). 예측[유도]: Qwen3 pp4096 +1.6…+5.3 %, pp512 ≈ 0; V4.1 lcg 0(호스트 union 그늘 아래), prose ≤ 2 %; GLM은 해당 없음(본 attention이 이미 top-k). 그쪽 보정값은 128 × 128 기하라 우리 64 × 8 커널로 옮겨 올 수 없다.
- **Puzzletron·prune: 보류.** 구조가 다른 모델이 되고 공개 파일이 아니게 된다(tiered requant와 같은 이의에 더 강하다). 같은 목적은 적응형 residency가 무손실로 쫓는다.
- **KV AutoQuantize: 보류.** 후보가 FP8/NVFP4뿐이고, KV는 적재 몫이 작다(V4.1 kv32k 110 MB).

**recentlit** (조사 라운드, 09-28; 09-21~09-26 조사 이후 새로 나온 것. 보고 원문 `specs/research/recentlit-report.md`, 리드 세션 사본):
- **검증 패스의 카드 m행 런치: 보류, H < C 뒤로.** 위 정정과 같다. 잴 항 하나는 Σ_l (F_l − H_l)⁺이다. 층별 카드 앞단이 호스트 다리를 넘는 몫의 합으로, ideaverify 재생기의 층별 적중에 τ 182 µs/슬롯과 nsys 층별 F를 곱해 Mac에서 계산한다. 이것이 εC ≈ 0.5–1.5 ms를 넘을 때만 박스에서 ε(둘째 열의 앞단 추가 몫)를 잰다. 참고로 llama.cpp mmvq.cu의 MoE 다중 토큰 커널도 토큰마다 warp이고, expert 단위로 묶지 않는다.
- **등록 가능한 shm 호스트 아레나(exllamav3 #341, 09-15, MIT): 보류, adaptres 설계 입력.** ideaverify V5의 "host-register 거부 → 스왑 H2D가 DRAM을 세 번 지난다"는 파일 매핑에만 맞다. 익명 mmap의 flags 0 등록은 성공했다(`specs/wave-m6/notes-hoststream.md:5`, H2D 26.25 GB/s). 등록한 사본이면 스왑은 V4.1 −0.27, GLM −0.58 ms/토큰[유도]이다. 잴 항 하나는 등록 시간(s/GiB)과 두 카드 PORTABLE 여부(박스 프로브)다. 0.02 s/GiB 아래면 전체 등록, 그 위면 스왑 후보만 또는 배경 등록.
- **Qwen3.8 라우팅 국소성(llama.cpp #27861, 열림): 채택, adaptres 입력.** 정적 top-32는 다른 절반의 약 10 %만 덮고(균등 6.2 %), 층별 LRU-64는 약 67 %, LRU-128은 약 81 %다. 역산한 적응형 α 0.15–0.19는 V4.1형이라, A6000 한 장(f 0.36–0.59)이면 적중 0.82–0.92[유도]다. 그 67/81 %는 재생값이라 부풀었을 수 있다. 잴 항은 Qwen3.8 라우터 트레이스 재생(Mac)이고, 박스 덤프가 전제다.
- **두 카드 텐서 분할(카드 직렬 앞단을 두 카드로): 보류.** V4.1 +3…+17 %, Qwen3.8 (b) −3…+28 %[유도, 폭이 넓음]이다. 결판은 카드 간 리덕션 한 번의 지연 t_red 하나다(박스 프로브, 같은 자리에서 `cuDeviceCanAccessPeer`). t_red ≤ 10 µs면 사용자에게 올리고, ≥ 20 µs면 기각한다. 합 순서가 바뀌고 층마다 카드 간 동기가 생겨 "심플·지속가능" 원칙과 부딪힌다.
- **검증 폭을 생존확률로 고르기(vLLM #47808, llama.cpp #27210): w = 1은 기각(≤ +2 %), w > 1은 uniongroup 설계 입력.** 패스가 행에 선형이라 규칙이 닫힌 꼴이다. 초안 i를 S_i ≥ (H + O)/step ≈ 0.56일 때만 검증하면 오늘 k* ≈ 4, adaptres 뒤 7–8[유도]이다. 잴 항은 DSpark 위치별 신뢰도의 보정 곡선이다.
- **Qwen3 검증 m행의 expert 묶기: Qwen3 draft 설계 입력.** m = 8에서 routed 바이트가 Qwen3-30B −19 %, Qwen3.6 −10 %[유도]이고, V4.1은 m = 2에서 −0.8 %라 묶을 이유가 없다. 잴 항은 우리 Qwen3 체인의 r(m) = pass(m)/pass(1)이다.
- **SAM 코퍼스 draft(exllamav3 `07e612fa5`, 09-27, MIT): 보류, Qwen3 draft의 공짜 층 후보.** 잴 항은 고정 코퍼스를 더했을 때의 수락으로, `tools/ref/draft-accept.py`에 코퍼스 팔을 더해 Mac에서 잰다.
- **AVX2 호스트 커널: 새 레버 없음.** KT #2212의 L2 M-타일링은 m_e ≳ 110부터 효과가 나는데, 우리는 G8에서도 m_e ≤ 86[유도]이다. 기각.
- **VAMP(2609.13537), Routide(2609.29032): 기각.** VAMP의 expert → KV 전환은 단일 스트림에서 적중 < 1점이다. Routide는 adaptres 게이트에 "용량 < 순환 작업 집합" 합성 케이스 하나를 남긴다.

**처분 규칙(사용자 09-28, "어드바이저와 상담해서 실험하고 이득이 명확하면 하는거지")**: 원장 항목은 항목마다 사용자에게 묻지 않는다. 어드바이저와 상담하고, 잴 항을 잰 뒤, 같은 임대 A/B의 구간 하한이 0보다 크고 효과가 예측 안에 들면 착륙한다. 프로브는 항을 정할 뿐이고, 이득의 증명은 구현 뒤 A/B다. 출력을 바꾸는 손실 근사(skip-softmax, MoE-Spec, 가지치기, 재양자화)는 이 규칙 밖이라 계속 사용자 결정이다.

**modeltools** (조사 라운드, 09-28; 공개 draft·학습기·보정 도구. 보고 원문 `specs/research/modeltools-report.md`, 리드 세션 사본):
- **Qwen3 공개 DFlash — 수락률 닫힘, s 대기**(e1, 09-28): 우리 Q4_K_M greedy 출력 48시퀀스(산문 24·코드 24, 앵커 24,576)를 Mac에서 재생했다. 걷기 AL은 폭 2에서 2.27, 폭 7에서 3.06이고, 산문과 코드는 폭 7에서 0.12 차이다(rig-log 09-28#q3dflash-accept). S(j) = AL/(1 + s·j + D/t1)로 두면 어느 s에서도 폭 2가 최적이다. s = 0.30이면 1.31배(Q8)·1.22배(bf16), s = 0.46이면 1.10배·1.04배다[유도]. 판정 항은 s 하나이고, 탐침 시팅의 P = 2–5 항목이 잰다. s ≤ 0.35면 구현 라운드를 연다(5층 llama 드래프트, attention 모양이 `flash_gqa` HEAD 128 GROUP 8과 같음, 행별 argmax 필요). s ≈ 0.46이면 m행 expert 대역(s를 바닥 쪽으로 내리는 레버) 뒤로 보류한다.
- **unsloth imatrix의 층×expert 카운트: 채택(XS–S).** 우리 GLM·Qwen3.8 첫 샤드 헤더의 `quantize.imatrix.file`이 공개된 `imatrix_unsloth.gguf`를 가리키고, 그 안의 `blk.N.ffn_*_exps.weight.counts`가 라우팅 카운트다. GLM에 없던 held-out 정적 목록이다(예측 적중 38–50 % @ f 0.233[유추]). 적응형 residency에는 이득이 약 0이다(시드 무관). 검증은 `macverify`의 GLM 트레이스 재생.
- **V4.1 DSpark의 다른 학습본: 없다.** 전부 `mtp.*` 재포장이다. 다른 변환기(JigSawPT)도 `dflash.target_layers = [37, 38, 39]`를 쓴다. 다만 같은 PR 포크의 변환기라 완전히 독립된 확인은 아니다.
- **GLM DSpark(RedHat): 보류.** k = 1 천장이 네이티브 MTP와 같고, `glmmtp` 사슬이 이미 있다. **Qwen3.8 DFlash(PixelML): 기각**(NVFP4 타깃 전용, `q38mtpd`가 이 모델의 draft). **Qwen3.6 draft들: 보류**(Qwen3-30B의 두 항과 `deltalanes` 뒤).
- **draft 트레이너(speculators, SpecForge, DeepSpec): 보류.** 셋 다 오프라인 은닉 상태 파일로 학습하고, A6000 한 장에 들어간다. 한계는 데이터량(30B 탭 24.6 KB/토큰)이다. 공개 draft의 수락이 공개 수치보다 크게 낮을 때만 연다.
- **k-quant 보정 도구(AutoRound의 GGUF 출력): 기각.** 같은 크기에서 더 낫다는 KLD 증거가 없고, 파일 교체는 사용자 결정이다. TorchAO·llm-compressor는 GGUF를 쓰지 않는다.

**ideaaudit-models** (우리 조사 22개의 점검, 09-28; 보고 원문 `specs/research/ideaaudit-models-report.md`):
- **고아, 박스 프로브 카드로:**
  - B′(gate·up GEMM + SwiGLU-q8_1 에필로그, 512스레드): Qwen3 pp4096 +3.3…+7.3 %[유도]. "B′는 지연 모형으로 다시 계산한다"는 약속이 이행되지 않았다. 잴 항은 배리어 항(ncu).
  - gemm_q6k: −2…−20 ms[유도]. A-Q6K 기각(`:559`, "Q4_K와 같은 읽기")과 q3gemmb 보고의 "q6k는 이제 L1에 묶였다"가 부딪힌다. 잴 항은 병목 단위(ncu).
  - GLM 디코드 틈(실측 47.7 대 예측 41–43 ms): 카드 쪽이면 약 +13 %[유도]. `:59`가 "GLM 시팅 nsys"로 미룬 뒤 돌리지 않았다. 잴 항은 q8_0 gemv GB/s(nsys).
  - Qwen3 QKV 한 런치: pp512 +2…+4 %[유도]. 잴 항은 P = 512 k·v 런치 시간(nsys).
- **고아, 빌드만:** Qwen3 flash SM당 3블록(레지스터 196 → ≤ 168): pp4096 +1.4…+2.8 %[유도]. 잴 항은 ptxas 레지스터와 스필. 잣대 가장자리라, 카드 캡처 안에서 나오는 경우에만 쓴다.
- **전제 변화:** glmops G3와 qwen4arch Q6-③의 "검증하면 호스트 바이트가 m개 토큰에 나뉜다"는 실측 합집합(k = 2에서 0.906)과 모순이다. GLM MTP k = 1은 +2…+17 %[유도]로 줄고, 순서(선택기 ‖ 프리필 ‖ 적응형 → MTP)는 그대로다.
- **보류:** 접착 사다리 F2·F3·F4(+4.7…+5.3 %, act 평면 뒤), H1(head_norm f64 → f32, +1.7…+2.3 %, 비트 재핀), gemmpipe c1a(act 평면 뒤), pf/pf2(흔적 0, 출처를 다시 읽는다).
- **산술로 기각:** ubatch 그래프 캡처 0.37 %, GLM hc_post 접기 0.7 %, 디코드 스텝마다 ProMoE식 프리페치(PCIe 0.64 ms 대 호스트 계산 120 µs), 로드 때 slab 재배치·A2 BN128(GEMM이 지연에 묶임).

**ideaaudit-card** (우리 조사 36개의 점검, 09-28; 보고 원문 `specs/research/ideaaudit-card-report.md`):
- **전제 변화 — r8(`1ad6599`) 뒤 V4.1 프롬프트의 병목이 바뀌었다[유도].** lcg P = 512는 route 창이 직렬로 드러난 합(67.2 ms/층-배치)이고, lcg P = 4096은 호스트가 묶고(카드 여유 약 16), prose P = 4096은 카드가 묶는다(호스트 35 대 카드 44–46). 같은 칸의 레버는 헤드룸 하나를 나눠 써서 더해지지 않는다.
- **B4(프로젝션 넷 IMMA): 순서를 t_IMMA 실측으로 정한다.** 09-26 결정(B1 → G → 스트리밍 → B4)은 "lcg는 호스트에 묶인다"는 전제 위에 있었다. 새 예측은 lcg P = 512 +14…+18 %, prose P = 4096 단독 +14…+28 %[유도]다. 반면 hoststream은 r8 뒤 상한 +15…+20 %로 절반이 됐다. 프로브에서 m = 128 네 프로젝션의 t_IMMA를 재고, 예측이 서면 B4를 스트리밍 앞으로 옮긴다(위 처분 규칙). 비트 틀(off 팔 불변식, on 팔 밴드 + PIN)은 09-26 결정 그대로다.
- **비트 동일, prose P = 4096 카드 헤드룸(약 10–12 ms/층-배치)을 나눠 씀:** batchwide shadow(+9…+14 %, `cardnext:249`), GT (e, ρ, t) 블록 순서(+4…+6 %, S, gtdram ncu). 둘을 합치면 헤드룸이 거의 찬다. IMMA shadow는 그 뒤 약 0이다.
- **down 활성값 q8_K:** 사용자 조건("h3tile을 먼저 올려 c를 실측")의 앞 절반이 r8로 섰다. 잴 항은 r8 뒤 union 벤치 m 8·16의 c다. 예측은 lcg +5…+20 %, prose 0[유도].
- **장부에만 있던 열린 레버:** 디코드 join 고정 비용 36 µs × 40층 = 1.44 ms, 목록 켠 스텝의 6.5 %(`plan-ledger:1018`). 잴 항은 목록 켠 디코드 nsys다. L2 프리페치는 0.7–1.3 %로 잣대 가장자리라 보류.
- **보류:** draft-ahead(+0.7…+3.9 %), conf_proj 적응형 k, populate를 업로드 밑에 겹치기, 뜨거운 engram 행 고정.
- **기각:** 상주 expert 자기 초안(수락 1이어도 plain과 같다), b4hc(`ac250bb`가 임계 경로 밖으로 옮김), 다중 블록 argmax 0.22 %, K9, KV fp8/fp4(손실, 디코드가 깊이에 평평), MoE-Spec(손실).
- **흐름 모형:** 오늘 흐름(r8, G2, 스트리밍 없음)을 재현하는 칸이 없다. `macverify`가 r8 상수 행을 넣고 위 예측을 다시 낸다.

**ideaaudit-host** (우리 조사 30개의 점검, 09-28; 보고 원문 `specs/research/ideaaudit-host-report.md`). 흐름 모형에 오늘 구성(B1 + T + G2 + r8)을 넣은 시간선[유도]: lcg P = 4096은 호스트가 묶고(0.95), prose P = 4096은 카드가 묶는다(0.93). 그래서 호스트 레버는 lcg에서만 값이 있다.
- **down 활성값 q8_K: 조건 충족, 라운드를 연다.** 09-28 결정(`:130`)의 조건은 h3tile-a의 c가 예측 안에 드는 것이었고(22.20 → 14.63 µs, `ffb6b41`), r8도 기본값으로 착륙했다. 예측[유도]: 목록 없음 lcg pp512 +6.8…+9.0 %, pp4096 +8.8…+11.8 %; prose +1.6…+5.0 %; 디코드 0. 잴 항 하나는 c_r8 중 down 몫(예측 5.0–8.5 µs)이고, 프로브 시팅의 union 벤치가 잰다. q8_K 뒤 lcg union은 W 바닥에 닿아, 호스트 계산 레버가 0이 되고 스트리밍만 남는다.
- ~~**hoststream: q8_K 뒤로 보류.** r8 뒤 상한은 lcg P = 4096 +17…+20 %[유도]로, r8 전 사다리(+37.8 %)의 절반이다. q8_K와 대체재라 q8_K 위에 붙이면 추가분은 +11…+13 %다.~~ 정정 09-28(streamdesign): 이 판단과 위의 "prose는 카드가 묶는다"는 빈도 목록 384 전제다. id 접두 기본값에서는 실제 텍스트가 호스트에 묶이고, 스트리밍이 q8_K보다 먼저다(산문 pp512 +47 %[유도]; hoststream 행). triage의 DRAM 프로브 명세(`union:4x8u0.125`)는 r8 전 union이라 낡았다.
- **(c′) prefill route enqueue를 SMT 형제 스레드로: q8_K 뒤로 보류.** lcg P = 4096 +3.0…+7.6 %[유도]. 잴 항은 G2의 `stat prefill` `enqueue_ms`(프로브 시팅).
- **새 텍스트의 engram 행이 차갑다: 잰다.** r8 뒤 파일 캐시 여유는 47.5 GB로 engram 표 84.6 GB의 56 % 이하만 상주한다. 완전히 차가운 P = 4096 프롬프트는 −3…−6 %, 호출 시작에 WILLNEED를 한 번에 내면 +2.6…+5.3 %를 되찾는다[유도]. 따뜻한 공개 표에는 0이다. 잴 항은 held-out 프롬프트 행의 페이지 캐시 상주율(mincore, 읽기 전용).
- **E10(층 l+1 라우터로 다음 층 호스트 행 미리 끌기): E10만 잰다.** plain 디코드 상한 +15…+27 %[유도, kr-research], DSpark에서는 0이다. 잴 항은 E10의 h(handoff x 덤프 → Mac 재생). 09-23 이래 측정되지 않았다.
- **V4.1 prefill route 그래프 캡처:** prose +2…+6.5 %[유도, 런치 간격 가정]. 기존 nsys sqlite로 런치 간격 합을 읽는다. CED 폭이 층마다 달라 그래프 키가 많다.
- **Qwen3.8 ubatch 전체 expert 스트리밍:** routed 바이트를 GGUF 헤더에서 세는 Mac 산수가 먼저다. 크기 L.
- **산술로 기각:** 행 분할(통째 배치가 2.1–4.0배 낫다), 요청별 draft 선택·E19, hc-lag 층간 겹침(`ac250bb`가 이미 가져감), CacheGen(속도 0), Q6_K 호스트 타일(GLM union의 0.9 %).
- 적응형 residency(`da7a3ea` 등)와 Qwen3.8 계열 여럿(`5ef6051`, `39357f6`, `cf3fbbf`)은 아직 main이 아니라 브랜치에 있다. 이들을 전제로 한 판정은 착륙 뒤 다시 본다.
- **ik `-ub ≥ 2048` 프리필의 호스트 expert 스트리밍**(`iktwo` 보고, 09-28): ubatch마다 호스트 expert를 카드로 복사하는 방식이고, 오프로드 버퍼를 3090에 두면 PCIe 천장이 약 546 tok/s[유도]다. **처분: 새 라운드 없음** — 우리 `hoststream` 카드(위)와 같은 레버이고, 그 예측(pp4096 링 128 prose 499, B1까지 544–573[유도])과 맞는다. 참조 일치로 기록.

**residency 교체 비용** (e1, 09-29; rig-log 09-29#cprobe, #resnsys, #odprobe, #odmax, #swapprio-ab, #odswap-ab):
- **교체 H2D를 2 MiB 청크로 나눠 페이스 맞추기(swappace): 효과 없음.** 청크를 스텝 포트의 go에 맞춰 풀어도 주기 초과는 그대로였다. 초과의 주인은 링크가 아니었다.
- **스테이징을 호스트 대기 창 안으로(stagewin): 효과 없음.** `stage_out_bytes 0`(창 밖 스테이징 0)인데도 초과가 약 20 ms로 거의 그대로였다. 그때 초과는 언팩 대기가 지배하고 있었다.
- **언팩 뒤 배치 대기 제거(unpacksimt 42블록 + 스트림 우선순위 swapprio): 채택.** nsys에서 무거운 스텝 초과가 6.14 → 3.40 ms로 줄었고, 두 카드 A/B에서 residency 디코드가 32.65 → 37.36 tok/s(1.144 ± 0.021, 3바퀴)였다. r3fix와 함께 착륙한다.
- **교체 원본 O_DIRECT(d, odswap): 보류, 브랜치 `odswap`에 둔다.** c 1.74로 스테이징 7.72의 4.4분의 1이고, 한 스레드가 속도 제한 없이 6.12 GB/s를 읽는다(`odmax`). 구현은 게이트를 통과했고 호스트 다리를 16.41 → 15.28 ms로 줄였다. 하지만 A/B는 1.006 ± 0.009로 자 안이다. 창별로는 교체가 몰리는 앞 두 창이 빠르고 뒤 두 창이 세 바퀴 모두 느리다. 뒤쪽이 느린 기제는 모른다. 또 O_DIRECT를 받지 않는 파일 시스템에서는 `SwapMachine::new`가 이름을 대고 멈추는 요구가 새로 생긴다. 다음 확인은 패스별 기록(`late`, `od_bytes`, `stage_us`)이다. `depth-ds41.sh`는 팔의 원시 출력을 변수로 읽고 곡선만 남긴 뒤 버린다. 그래서 그 기록을 남기는 러너 줄(팔 출력 보관)이 먼저 필요하다.
- **익명 등록 영역 b-전체: 보류.** 직접 DMA c는 0.62로 가장 싸다. 그러나 모델 파일이 페이지 캐시에 있으면 204 GiB 사본이 RAM에 들어가지 않고, 참조 엔진의 따뜻한 로드와 부딪힌다. 등록 비용 팔은 `READ_ONLY` 익명 등록에서 801로 실패해 값이 없다.
- **GDS: 보류, 사용자 판단.** A6000은 지원하고 3090은 지원하지 않는다(GDR). NVMe P2PDMA 경로는 모듈 옵션 둘과 설정 하나, 재부팅이 필요하다(원장 B3의 정정 줄). (d)가 착륙한 뒤 남은 초과를 보고 판단한다.

- **Host streaming in a prompt call (callstream, `BLOOMERY_HOSTSTREAM`): landed off by default; on by default under a residency since the user's decision of 2026-09-30 (unset follows `BLOOMERY_RESIDENCY`).** Two rounds each, same binary (rig-log 09-30#callstream-pp-a, #callstream-pp-bp): pp4096 +3.8 % on plan (a) and −1.5 % on (b′), under both cards' bands (+10…+22, +8…+19); pp512 flat. The decode after the call is +20 % / +16 % on (a) and +18 % / +12 % on (b′) after 512 / 4096 prose tokens, because the call's picks stay for the decode. The pp miss is not staging (backlog 0, all 584 pick records). Summing the same logs' per-layer-batch records (round 1, P = 4096, off vs on; round `cspp`, report in the lead's specs `release/cspp-out/report.md`): the host union fell 9,746 → 7,350 ms, and the chain thread's enqueue + wait rose 1,149 → 3,280 ms, taking almost all of it back; the card's shadow phase (`card_in_ms`) rose 2,720 → 4,630 ms, so the prompt turned from host-bound to card-bound. The chain's new block is in the code: under streaming `shadow_pick` reads the route's ids through `routed_ids`, which calls `set.routed.synchronize()` on the chain thread once a pick (`crates/gpu/src/host/batch.rs:484`, `crates/gpu-deepseek41/src/body/prefill.rs:2342`), and the streamed pass waits for the pick's copies on the engine stream (`prefill.rs:2381`). Round 1's off row also paid the lease's cold first 4096-id read (prologue 515 ms against 227 ms). Levers [derived, not measured]: read the ids after an event instead of a chain-thread sync (8a's C1 track); cap admissions at the balance point (+5…+7 % at pp4096); pick from the previous group's counts so the fill gets a head start; per-expert landed events (`crates/gpu/src/host/swap.rs:2519` records one for the whole pick). The one term the logs cannot split is the growth of `card_in` into the landed wait, the streamed kernels and the pass split: nsys at `prose:512` with streaming on, layer 15 (20 admissions), which first needs `tools/ref/nsys-ds41.sh`'s prefill form to accept the corpus arms.

**TensorFold `c464617`** (0.6.0, Apache-2.0 since 0.6.0; investigation round `tensorfold`, 10-01; original report at `specs/release/research/tensorfold-report.md`, the lead session's copy). Its CUDA path needs sm_89+, so it does not run on our cards, and no number of theirs goes into our tables.
- **A. Reduced Qwen3.8 MTP head (`BLOOMERY_MTP_HEAD_ROWS`): to validate.** The lever exists but was never timed. The full Q8_0 head is 675.4 MB per walk × 3 walks = 2.03 GB per window. A list of 79,591 rows saves 2.0–2.3 ms per window, for a net +3…+6 % decode [derived]; coverage loss is the term that remains. Settled by a same-binary A/B (A6000, prose P 512/4096, 6 rounds), with the list built from text disjoint from the measured prompts.
- **B. Per-round width from draft confidence: to validate.** `MtpDraft.p` is already read back but `chain` drops it. A row pays when prefix acceptance > 0.665 [derived]. Fixed widths come out within 0.5 % [derived], so any gain comes from the per-round spread, which is unmeasured. Settled by a functional run that prints each window's (p_j, accepted_j), plus a Mac replay. Size S.
- **C. Exact sampled drafting: hold (L).** Today sampled requests are never drafted. 0…+60 % on sampled decode [derived]; acceptance under coupling is the unknown. Its first step is XS on its own: the sampler draws even when one candidate survives (`crates/sampler/src/lib.rs:299-304`), so draw n = position n.
- **D. Replay recurrent state instead of one lane per row: hold.** +0.9…+1.5 % at P 4096, under the ruler alone [derived, assuming the delta kernel is bound by state bytes]. Only alongside E.
- **E. Wider windows: hold, behind B and D.** 0…+5 % [derived].
- **F. Two verify rows per MMA tile (`flash_gqa.rs:43-45`, 8 of 16 rows idle): hold.** ≤ +1.3 % at P 4096 [derived upper bound].
- **Rejected:** trees (routed bytes are re-read per position), DSpark k ≥ 2 at fixed width, a bf16 lane matmul (our q8 m-column path is already row-independent), FP8/NVFP4/cluster kernels (sm_89+), a ring margin in place of the V4.1 shadow (≈0). Multi-stream shared rounds are throughput, not single-stream: hold.

**Resident slots in one pass** (line1's DeepGEMM round, out-of-scope spot, 10-05; line2 owns): today a qwen3 seat round
of N slots is N passes, one slot each (`crates/gpu/src/model/slots.rs`, `Engine::advance_slots`), so the dense
weights are read N times a round. One pass over all N slots reads them once; the m ≤ 8 arm already takes several
columns. **Hold (L), behind A8s.** Prediction for Qwen3-30B-A3B at N = 2 [derived, parameter counts, not measured]:
dense per token ≈ 1.2 B params (attention 0.91 B + head 0.31 B), routed ≈ 1.81 B; a round reads 6.0 → 4.8 units,
round −20 %, aggregate ≈ ×1.25 if the step is byte-bound, more where it is latency-bound (launches halve). Per-slot
attention stays per slot (separate KV planes). The term to measure first: our r(m) = pass(m)/pass(1) on the qwen3
chain at m = 2 (the same term as the recentlit "verify m-rows" line above).

- **llama.cpp b11443 speed changes** (10-06, GLM rounds lcpp-cuda and lcpp-host; reports in the lead specs
  `leader/lcpp11443/report-{K,H}.md`): nothing predicts ≥ 1 % on a greedy headline.
  - #29184 (the shared expert rides the routed MMVQ launch), ledger only. Folding our shexp gate_up (+ q8_1 + sh_down)
    into the routed `_sel` launches saves 2–3 launches per MoE layer: −68…−102 µs at L = 40 and c_node 0.852 µs, which
    is 0.2–0.3 % of the V4.1 step [derived]. It is 0 under residency, because it sits in the host bridge's shadow.
  - #29901 (the 4-head indexer tile; it dispatches for n_head == 4, i.e. qwen4exp, not GLM). Our `qsa_score` already
    stages the pooled key tile once per 8 rows. The residue is the per-row barrier pair and the 4× shared re-read, a
    ceiling of 10–20 % of that kernel. It is 0 at P ≤ 4096 (no scoring below position 2048); revisit at ≥ 32k contexts.
  - #29393 (RMS_NORM + SCALE), have: every norm of ours is one fused launch.
  - #27851 (CPU k-quant tiles), already rejected at the KT #2212 line above (m_e ≤ 86 < break-even).
  - **#27694 rejection-sampling verify (adopt candidate, serve at temp > 0):**
    - The problem: our drafted seats accept by exact match (`crates/runtime/src/speculative.rs:202`
      `accepted_rows`), so acceptance falls with temperature.
    - The fix: accept with min(1, p/q) and draw the residual from norm(max(0, p − q)). This keeps the distribution
      exactly.
    - Upstream measured +5–13 % acceptance length for draft-mtp at temp 0.7.
    - Predicted +4–12 % serve decode tok/s at temp 0.7 on q38/glmmtp [derived from upstream's band]. 0 on greedy
      headlines.
    - Out of scope: the V4.1 DSpark block draft.
    - Trap: the n-gram lookup draft keeps greedy verify (#29924's bug).
    - The draft's q already exists (`crates/gpu/src/mtp.rs`).
  - **Check (S): post-EOG kept rows** (#29638's class). `generate` truncates the emitted tokens at the first EOG
    (`crates/runtime/src/lib.rs:268`) after the verify has committed `kept` rows past it. If a serve seat keeps the
    context across turns, those rows can survive into the next turn's prefix. One serve trace confirms it, and the
    likely fix is to bound `kept` at the EOG.
  - Baseline movement: re-cut the llama.cpp rows at ≥ b11443 for Qwen3.8 (mainline draft-mtp #29761, upstream 1.55×
    on DGX Spark), GLM-5.3 (mainline #27773, still undrafted) and V4.1 (mainline, no longer the PR branch). Qwen3.6
    and Clef move a little (#29184, #29393). The V4.1 llama.cpp pp4096 arm has stood FAIL since 09-28 and must be
    resolved at that sitting. The box's `llama.cpp-mainline` (`53ed051ce`) moves first. The sitting needs the user's
    approval (> 30 min).
